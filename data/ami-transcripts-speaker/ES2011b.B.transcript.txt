Just uh You may need to But sometimes you have to do it it's like a three set setting cycle, so press it a couple times, hold down function and then press F_ eight. Adjusting. The cable might be a little loose or something. Oh, you got it. How do I um Right. Okay so this is on the working design, which is sort of the uh mechanical functions of the remote, um and the method I used was to basically look at existing designs and incorporate ideas from our last meeting. Um so I think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions, the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the T_V_. And also we talked about um a location function where maybe you could press a button on the T_V_ and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is. So the components we need are an energy source to power the remote, um input which would probably be buttons, although um we just talked about voice recognition, processor to take the information, um something to transmit it to the T_V_, and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output, like possibly a beep or a vibration. And also you need a sender for location signal, which would probably be a separate um thing that we'd have to sell with the remote and people could stick it on their T_V_ or stick it on their wall. And this is just sort of an overview of how the remote works. Power comes from the battery, goes to the chip, um and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb which is probably the easiest way to send to the T_V_. And then for the location function, you would have a sender on the T_V_ which would output some sort of signal, um we could use I_R_ but we'd probably wanna use radio instead. That signal would go to a receiver which it would process it, and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up. Um so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be uh, battery for the energy source, that way you wouldn't have to plug it in, um a button pad for input, um we can purchase a pre-made chip which will handle all the processing stuff, I_R_ transmitter to communicate to the T_V_, that's just sort of standard, um so most T_V_s have an I_R_ receiver. Probably a radio receiver to send out location function and to receive it and I'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself. So that concludes my presentation. Mm? Yeah, uh I d I was an engineer before I came here. It's easy to implement. Locator. Well I was thinking about that but uh I mean speech recognition is really hard to programme, and also, if the T_V_ is on it's making sound and the people on the T_V_ are talking, and if somebody says like one, then the T_V_'s gonna switch itself to channel one, or it seems like a silly, I'm not sure how you would implement it. It's a cool idea but Well you would have to have a button on a T_V_ or on your wall or some place since the T_V_ already has power. Yeah you click the button, it's gonna send out a signal, and I was thinking, I_R_ is line of sight, so unless the remote is like actually in front of the T_V_ it's not gonna work, um so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone. Sends out a signal and then the the remote hears the signal and so it beeps probably. It would have to be sold separately because if the sender's on the remote then you'd have to find the remote first to click the button to find the remote. Yeah, it'd probably just stick it on your T_V_ so if you need to find the remote, click the button. Yeah, so it would be a two part package. Yeah I think so. Um on the T_V_ or on the phone? Um it seemed like a a beep seemed the most reasonable to me, I think that's what the phone has, I mean when you need to find your phone, you just have someone call it and it starts ringing somewhere and then you can figure out that it's in the couch or wherever. Does anyone know if V_C_R_s are the same across international? Okay, so you'd need like a whole different set of buttons for everybody's V_C_R_s. Yeah, other than that region and coding thing. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I never think to hold something down. Yeah, you can have the number going around in the corner. Doesn't it rotate though, so it'll be moving around. Mm-hmm. If it works on an iPod then it works. I don't have one. Oh. Yeah. I don't think so. I don't think it's the wheel dealy. Yeah.. And they're re-programmable aren't they? You can put on your songs and then put on a different set, that's probably why they're expensive, they're like little computers. Mm-hmm. I A D_V_D_ is simple, you just have play, pause, eject, and menu maybe. Oh yeah. But it's cool to have it all on one, because you wanna turn it on then you wanna turn up the volume, and then you wanna go to the menu, so you don't wanna switch. Well but D_V_D_ is only like four buttons. Oh. But I think the circle only does channel isn't applicable to D_V_D_ really 'cause you don't wanna but volume is and volume is actually controlled on the T_V_ so you don't have to switch. Yes we can try that.
