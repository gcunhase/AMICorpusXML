Uh sure my name is Agnes and I'm an user usability user interface designer. Um I was wondering Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Well, no, not exactly. I mean my job from what I understood was to look at the usability requirements and make sure that the product is usable, it's acceptable to the people who are gonna use it and look at the best ways to do that. So I think I'll have to interact with Christine and discuss with her, so that she's not designing something that my studies will show right off the bat that it's not going to work, and so it's sort of it's a loop that feeds in, but I don't think necessarily that I'm in a coordinating position for it. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Which will also feed into the marketing, because depending on what users want, depends on how you sell it, what tag lines you attach to it, how you try to make it more attractive to users. So I think all three groups will need to interact quite a bit. Um, and then I guess build the plan based on all of that, because I think you need to take all the factors into account. Yeah, of course. Yeah, we can C_C_ him on any discussions or documents that are passed around. Sure. No problem. So, the immediate next step is to start determining the functional design, or okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, yeah, that would be useful. Sure. Okay. Thanks. Thank you.
