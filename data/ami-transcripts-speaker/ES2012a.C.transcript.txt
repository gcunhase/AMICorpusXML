I'm Kendra and I'm the Us User Interface Designer and um I haven't had a whole lot of experience in this kind of thing before but I'm m so I'll be working on the design. Right. Yep, I'm just open to being creative. Um probably a duck I just I li I like the way they look and they're just nice animals and I like how they can fly or swim or walk around or whatever. Well I think I find a lot of them really complicated to use with all the different buttons and uh it's handiest when you have one that works both the D_V_D_ player or whatever and the T_V_ as well. Um, but that it's easy to if you can switch back and forth instead of having to press a bunch of different buttons and so I think it's is best when they're clearly labelled and you can see which buttons you're supposed to use, you know. Yeah. I think something that's comfortable to hold because sometimes you get the remote controls that are just those big, rectangular things and uh they're kind of awkward to hold onto, so something that's more comfortable that fits in a person's hand better. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But maybe they could be concave instead of sticking up to have them be kind of down so you could feel them better. Oh yeah. Like a like a mobile phone? Yeah. Well, most I think most of the remote controls now are either just black or grey, so maybe we should go with something different or be able to I was just thinking of um what they're doing with mobile phones now how you can get the different um what are they called? Like the face-plates that you change so we could have maybe I don't know if it would be feasible to do something with that, where you can change the face-plates or have kind of a variety so people can get different different things. Have it kind of look how they want to, different colours, things like that, probably just plastic because that's always the lightest. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
