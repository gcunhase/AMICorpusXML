Next please. So, now uh we have a product. Very happy. But uh, is it cheap enough? Um, so if uh I'll have a look. We have a battery. One battery. Okay, one battery. Electronics. Advanced chip. Yeah it's the most advanced. Chip-on-print. We have that one. We have the simple, regular and advanced. We have the adva advanced. 'Kay, so uncurved or flat. Nope. Single curved or double curved? We have double curved. So Then we have plastic, wood, rubber. we have half rubber, half plastic. No titanium. Special colour. Yes, yellow. Interface, push-button. Scroll-wheel, integrated scroll-wheel push push-button, or L_C_D_ display. So, we have the L_C_D_ We have two scroll-wheels? Or one? And it's not really a s Yeah, it's this one. Now, uh button supplement. Special colour. We already Uh, that's the from the for the buttons. The buttons are regular colour. So, then uh then then then then then then Then Uh, no. It's too expensive. So, we have to change something. Fifteen Euros. Yeah, well uh when we lose one scroll-wheel, it's okay. 'Cause we can't lose the battery. We can't lose the advanced chip. We can't lose the double curve. We have rubber, special colour. Oh, no, we No, it's uh Sorry? Um, then we uh lose two Euros. Then we have thirteen Euros. Half a Euro too much. Exactly the special colours. So That's one Euro. So, I don't think that's good. Mm I think we have to keep the L_C_D_. If Yes. Then it's only thirteen Euros. So uh yeah. Yeah. Then you have Or you have to cut this off. Then it's not good anymore. So, wait. Okay. I'll have a look. We Yellow rubber. Yeah, normal. Uh One minute, please. Uh Is it maximum. Um Yeah, it's normal colour. But if you lose the joystick, it's still uh an advanced chip? Or it's then a regular? So, the advanced is for the L_C_D_ and the regular for the joystick. And what if we lose the L_C_D_? Yeah, regular chip. But Is it a good design? Mm, yes. Then it's okay. Okay, so no joystick. Oh no, but we then we get push-buttons from half a Euro. Uh, yes, yes, yes, yes. No joystick. Push-buttons. No special colour. Twelve and a half Euros. Then it's okay. So, we have to change that a little bit. And you cannot use the red and green button. Because if you give them a s uh colour, you have to pay point two Euros. Yes. Yes. So So Well Now we have to change that, but that's okay. Rubber. What's the normal colour? So And Where's? Yeah. So, now it's Yeah. It is. But then it will be just that ones. Now it's Very good. Now, uh project eva evaluation. Well What do you think of it? Uh About the project. Okay. And you. Okay. Okay. Well, what do I have to say. I think it was good. Not too many discussions. So, it's good for the speed. So, I think we're ready. Good price. Evaluation ready. Ready. That's it.
