Is it an only a single mic or a microphone array? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. The cost would be le reduced. Is that two or one? Now what is the whole day rating for that? Whole day's rating. What type of battery? Something like a two A_, A_ three size batteries? Mm-hmm. And the L_C_D_ is this one, on the remote? Yeah. Uh-huh and also the switch. Okay. Mm-hmm. And I think you forgot a point here to have an button to find the charger, because that's a major that's a Okay and if you disable speech recognition system then? Mm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm. Okay. Yeah people are willing to pay more, but the company is not willing to invest more at the moment. Or uh Something like customised. Yeah. Mm hmm hmm hmm. Hmm okay. And this is other one? Mm hmm hmm hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah that's fine. Okay. Mm hmm hmm hmm. With the charger? I think we can use Excel. Yeah it's a nice input but we have an other inputs from the l public demands. I think we will just have a rough look and then we can make our statements, and we can finalise the product based on this discu I think we can just go to my presentation then. We can wind up. Or we could uh come to some f uh final conclusions. So the marketing made an evaluation criteria and these were some of the findings, and uh in the market the people are not really interested with L_C_D_, without L_C_D_, with speech recognition interface, or without speech recognition interface, but most of the people what they are interested is first thing is, they want to have an fancy look and feel, it should be very fancy with colourful and uh very handy to hold. And the second thing is it should be much more technologically innovative. Of course in that we could put L_C_D_ or recognition to be more technologically innovative. And the third one is easy to use. Okay and if we go to the next slide, here you can find these are the latest fashion updates, and so this in Paris and Milan they have detected this trends that the this year it's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable, so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or a vegetable, or whatever they like. So I think it should be much more customised to make a different uh shapes. And the second thing is, and if the material, they really do not want it to be very hard, as in the case of very pl plastic or titanium, it should be somewhat spongy. Um. Yeah so uh so finally we have these three criterias. One is fancy look, second is innovative, and third is easy to use. So these are the f uh three criteria on which we are going to build our remote. So and we have an evaluation criteria for each one of these, say that we have a seven point scale, from one to seven, and for each of the product you could just give me the scale according to this. So now you have with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_, so on this scale, if it is true, if it is if it has a fancy look you could just tell me one, or if it is false, it doesn't it looks uh it doesn't look much fancy, then you could just tell me seven. So We can make our study on this and No no we have you have designed two products now, one is with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_. According to you, no according to you designers, how will feel does it uh with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_? Okay let us make this L_ and without L_C_D_. On on this scale the L_C_D_ remote control. How do you look how does it look? D is it very fancy or doesn't look much fancy? And you both agree for that? So I take three on with L_C_D_? So without L_C_D_ how would you rate it? Four. And in the sense of innovativeness, with L_C_D_. Five with L_C_D_ and So without L_C_D_? No no according to design aspect we want to know how would you feel the innovativeness? With L_C_D_. And without L_C_D_? Okay. No actually uh to make it with L_C_D_ you make more efforts. So I there is high innovativeness included if you make it with L_C_D_ y then when it is without L_C_D_ there is not much innovativeness. So we can't go I mean that what you are sayin that's what the design No it's like this, I mean on the L_C_D_, according to what I understand from your model is, you have a joystick here, and you have L_C_D_, you just press your joystick, you get here a programme. Uh then No on the T_V_ you don't it doesn't display on the T_V_ now. L_C_D_? Then uh there is no meaning in having it on the T_V_. Or then again you have a channels, volume and all the stuff and what a I mean that depends upon your design, so I mean So without L_C_D_ you want to put it fi the same level of innovativeness? And which do you recommend e easy to use, with L_C_D_ or without L_C_D_? Yeah. Or we can just go back to the previous slide uh where we ha we have a few updates. So I mean in the product design you could just amend it to make some few changes according to fruit and vegetable or a spongy touch without L_C_D_ and without speech recognition. Even then our product is going to be very good. Yeah. Yeah that's right. Yeah yeah that's right. So without L_C_D_ I just take it five? Or you want it to be six? S s oh I think it's better to have this without L_C_D_. As our Programme Manager s Pro Project Manager says that without L_C_D_ it is going to reduce the cost also, and it's going to be much simpler to use. So. That's going to be an optional. If somebody wants to buy it they can have it, otherwise no. It's an optional. Yeah. Yeah, but I mean if you have an add-ons, the kids may just uh hide the parental module and so that their parents can't use it. In the same set, yeah, and and individual buttons to make them work. I mean how to how to how to make a marketing survey that uh how many married couple or how many couples have a T_V_ or to the number or singles who have a television. So based on that I think But you can make it on a single P_C_ with three different options. On the same P_C_B_ yeah yeah. Yeah that's right. I mean you could just provide with an optional. So it's something like a Microsoft product update. Updates and we sell it. We make updates and sell it. And uh what's the idea about uh the shape of the remote controls? Uh can they be made into a fruit and vegetable types? Do you require different types of P_C_B_s and Or uh it could be like this the P_C_B_ would be the same for all, but only the exterior uh shape is different o for all. Yeah, yeah that's right. Yeah that's right. I think you need to look into the material. Yeah yeah. I think the Project Manager would be interested to look about the financial issues in making these models. I feel it's fine, we know we don't need uh I think it's okay. This is fine for making a presentat for project presentations. And the leadership was excellent. Yeah that's right. Yeah that's right. And new ideas found. Any new ideas to make these presentations more interactive and more interesting? I mean uh what type of product would you think could we make this more interesting? Yeah that is within the budget. And the evaluation was Yeah that's right. And the next is celebration. So Yeah thank you, thank you very much.
