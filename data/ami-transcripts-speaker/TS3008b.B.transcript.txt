Here we go again. Oh. Okay. Mm, okay. Yeah, it's okay. Okay. No. In project. No can that open. Open it there. Okay. About the get Okay. But nothing restricted for user interface? With technical I don't know. 'Kay. Okay. But I kind of uh Yes. Uh Well, the technical functions. Um, well I don't know if you got the same uh pictures as I got, but uh I got these two, and I think they're we have to focus uh on uh the uh one hand the expert view or the novice user. th I think it's it's very much uh depending on the user requirements, I don't s uh know who's doing t Yeah, but it I think that's very important to watch uh what kind of functions there we want to uh put in a remote control. Yeah, well y we can put functions in it when uh yeah, when we uh get the user requirements uh and we can update it. Well, yeah w if you want try a a a huge market, if you want to reach a huge market, uh like elderly people and we have to choose for novice user. But I don't know. It's it's really um depending on how how how far the the the remote controls are already in n um in use. Yeah, probably, yeah. Uh well, there are l at least uh basic functions, uh like just th the channels uh one till nine, uh on and off switch, which must be clear with a red button or something like that. Um, most standard uh have volume, of course, and a mute function, and, of course, the next and previous channel. I think that's just basic what we need. And from that on we can user requirements what we need more. Uh Yeah, I just um um I thought Joost was looking at the trendy the trends in the markets, and I don't know if there uh are any um uh if you put more functions, more buttons, maybe it's com becoming less trendy or something like that. M you can just you can k you can keep it in mind that. I don't know. Uh, I th I thought the the with less buttons you can make a more trendier uh yeah, more trendier design, I think. I think. Yeah? Uh, well, that's all I have to say, I think. Yeah, that was it.. Okay. Well No way. Yeah. But what's our slogan? The slogan uh Puts fashion in electronics. Sense simplicity. Yeah. Yeah, but wha But Yeah, but you sai you said that that a lot of functions aren't used. So why should j we put this function in? I think more I think uh people younger people are more looking for just a trendy look than uh more functions. Yeah, but uh you said Yeah, d yeah, but th the functions are not in the remote control we're making. It's n Yeah. Yeah. No. No, new requirements say no. So Yeah, but I i if it's too simple uh th they won't use the remote control, they use their own th th with lot more functions. No, no. Exactly. Mm, yeah. Yeah, but just keep it simple and look more at th No. It's only for television. So Yeah. Yeah, nothing more. Exactly. Yeah. The user interface is easy. And the basic yeah, basic functions, yeah. It's too much integrated in the other. Yeah. Will you look Look at the market. Well Yeah, I uh, it's Sunday I always use it for the uh yeah, for the soccer uh Well, uh when you uh uh when you look uh for example um, a couple of weeks ago I looked at the for the flights, and there are a lot of flights in one page, so if if th Yeah, but True.
