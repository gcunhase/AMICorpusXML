Two. Good morning. Mouse. Come on. There we are. Let's just check one more time. Mm. Yeah. One uh most to the right. Yes that one. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Purple. Looks very nice. A pink elephant. The water is important. Yeah. Yeah. Like this? Okay. Um let's make it um a dog. Ooh. Ah okay. A pig? I can make a dog. Um 'Kay, I make a cat of it. Oh, not too quick. No I have it. I just draw too quick I think. Okay, that's it. More. It's just to get used to it. Yeah, that's right, it but you actually got to write on the paper. You really got to write on that paper. Yeah, but it's just a picture. You really No. It's a donkey. Uh I think it was uh Yeah. Piece of cake. Uh easy. Universal. And only television? Or more devices? Ah okay. Not just a T_V_. Okay. Well we can try to make it special. Well Yeah. Nothing N It shouldn't be too big, but I don't think we can make it too small, 'cause it has to have a lot of functions, so. We can't make it smaller than the things we see now I think. Yeah. Or we have to make something uh like uh mobile phones that you can uh fold it opem. Maybe then you can make it s smaller and uniquer, maybe more trendy. Fold open, where you can see uh more options. I think Yeah, something uh on top, just dren general things like volume and T_V_ channels and inside things you don't use that often. Yeah b I wanted No you can make an uh manual in it. But that's Yeah, I think it's much uh too expensive. Yeah, too fragile. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe that's a good idea, but yeah, we have to look at the price now I think. Well uh how much is your uh standards uh mobile phone recharger? Maybe have uh Yeah, 'cause well Yeah. Maybe uh use it as a separate option. Sell it uh separately. Rechargeable. Yeah. Yeah. Well I think we have to look at that, 'cause well you can do the standard way, but then you won't Well you can um have uh the basic things on the same place, like on off button on top and the T_V_ channels one two three four as a block, and then the volume uh obviously on t on top, so you can see. But the rest is uh you don't use that often, so if you have a clear button with an good icon on it, it should be clear as well. So it doesn't matter what place it is on the remote control I think, so you can do something unique with that. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. That's what I meant. Uh Okay, but yeah. No, what you want to do with it. Yeah, I also wrote down some stuff that you want on a Technical fun fu What do you want to do with your remote control, what do you need on your remote control. I already wrote some down, some ideas. Yep. There's already a document in the folder about it. Okay. I will. It didn't say that. Your fault. Bye bye.
