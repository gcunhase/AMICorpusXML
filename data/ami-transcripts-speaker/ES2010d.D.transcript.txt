I wanna find our if our remote works. Oh. Whoohoo. That's nice. Good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I think it's a beautiful Yeah. Good job, you guys. Those are really good. Okay, it's a PowerPoint presentation. I don't really know exactly what we should uh talk about. It's under evaluation. Alright. Um so these are the criteria we're gonna ask, is it easy to use, is it fashionable uh yeah, I guess we should write these down so we can reference them. Like does it feel good, like yeah, physically. That's just for current trend. It doesn't really count, you guys. Yeah. But it's so we do have removable covers, right? Yeah, well then that's covered. And so we n k everybody have that? Yeah, she's got it. It's good. Yeah. Okay so, we're using the criteria uh for a seven point scale, and so we need to discuss how we feel. It falls within this range, so for easy to use, do we feel it's very easy to use? You guys Okay. Oh wait, that's false. Okay. Two. That's what I say. Okay, fashionable? No. I mean like no, I think it's very fashionable. I thi I would give it a one. Well, that's that's just like that's a clay, it's a prototype. What do you think? Okay. Yeah, it's a two. That's okay. Yeah. Um does it feel good? I feel like I think it feels good. I'll give it a two. What do you say? Okay. Oh no, it's fine, you're I mean you're Project Manager. Um yeah, I mean and it does it have voice I mean the phrase recognition on it? And there's no way you can represent it on here. Y Yeah, so. Then yes, then I would well it isn't what else would it need for it to be technologically innovative? And it doesn't cover anything other then T_V_, so I'd probably give it a three. Even though it is for just a T_V_ remote it's uh very advanced. But it is just a T_V_ remote. Well yeah, so I'd give it a two. Oh, it's very capable of being squishy and fruity. Yeah. Okay, next. So um our re model slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie appears to be a winner, and uh hopefully we'll sell millions. Good job, team. What? It it does. Thanks. Two. Yeah. Yeah, let's let's do a lithium. We're gon that's gon Nologically advanced, yeah. Yeah. Uh. Yeah. We plastic. And special colour. But it's Yeah, but i so i But will we w actually we'll need two, won't we? One for the top and then one for the s one e for each side. Okay. Like because there's like one interface right here and then because it's not gonna be on the same plane when you press the button. There's gonna have to be additional signals on the sides. So is that gonna be an extra one on each side? Or three, because of one on each side and one on top. I mean it's fine 'cause it comes out the same as twenty nine. Well less than twenty nine even. They're a special colour. Um they're uh they're a special form, 'cause they're indented. And, they're a special material. We're under. I think we just discuss it. Oh that's true. Yeah. No, yeah, that's a good point. 'Cause I'd forgotten that that wasn't our decision, yeah. Oh, overall I mean I thought we did a good job like We got to choose basically we had control over minus it being just merely a T_V_ remote we got to choose what we wanted to do with it. And we're a fashion forward technology company. Minus that one fight. Yeah. Yeah. I mean minus you guys being wha what is it, the survey, annoying or what is it? Irritating, yeah. Wow that's a it's definitely a strong one. Yeah. Yeah, and no internet. And the digital the digital pens were they were pretty cool. Yeah they were fun, even though I'm not really sure what I could do with them, but they are awesome. Yeah. And these things whoa. Yeah. And Big Brother. Yeah. Um we are really gonna sell this. Ta-da. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, 'cause they're pretty and just like Uh yeah. Yeah, no, iPods They want all those words for presentation, even the plugs. Oh yeah, everybody. Mine is amber. Oh. Look at it. That is a piece of work. Wow. Marketing Director says yeah. Fashionable people will buy it. Oh, I will create desire. We could have like an Adam and Eve type commercial, and that's the fig-leaf. Mm. That'll sell. Yeah. Yeah. You too.
