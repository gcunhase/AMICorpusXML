Hi. Oh yeah, we have to talk in English, huh. I'm afraid I'm a bit slow for this stuff uh. I'm afraid I'm a bit too slow. I don't know how much preparation you guys did, but not a lot. Mm-hmm. Not yet. Operations. Different pen widths, how do you do that? Oh okay. Are you serious? I in the file option menu. How much time do we have to draw anyway? 'Cause I can take forever on this. Is this part of our a acquai or introduction to each other? Alright. Uh. Your line broke. I'm guessing a turtle. No. I'm kidding. Because of its shell. Dude you're a good drawer. Do you have a turtle pet? Uh okay. Yeah yeah yeah. Stumpy stuff. They kind of l look like mole legs. With sharp nails on. A little tail maybe. Uh no. The little holes maybe. And why did you choose this animal? Alright. Alright. Colours were under format right? Let's see. How am I gonna do this? Um Mm uh. Not quite actually. No. Aye. It's a cat. Not quite yet through. Uh yeah I dunno. They're my favourite pets. Uh I have colour already. Yeah I'm not so good at drawing with this kind of st Oh shit. Um Excuse my language. I don't know how to draw its face. But you get the idea. It's a cat. It's my favourite uh pet animal, 'cause they're cute, they're independent and cuddly, I dunno. That's it. Or do I need to use more colours and Alright. Yeah. So we have to s Yeah. Mm-hmm. I guess so. Yeah. True. Well I started making an overview for myself, um what I had to do, 'cause we have three design steps and in every step I have a s specific task to perform or whatever. So I had to uh, I dunno, make an overview for myself about what I have to do, and kind of let it work in to get ideas about well how I have to fill it. Well I started I started with the first phase, I think was the functional. And uh let's see I had to focus on the working design, which you said. How does the apparatus work? And well I basically had two points. Uh according to the coffee uh machine example, I have batteries to supply energy, and we ye use button presses to activate or deactivate certain functions on the T_V_. And that's basically all I have so far. Alright. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah I kept it global 'cause that it activates or deactivates specific functions, 'cause I wasn't thinking yet about that. I mean, you wanna ch ch flip the channel but you might wanna use teletext also. I dunno what the word is in English. Uh Yeah. Obviously. Whoa. Is that you or alright. Alright. Alright. Well no I'm just a bit wondering what we're gonna do the next uh session? Yeah okay. We'll do our best. I am gonna work on the conceptual design already 'cause yeah it's fairly important to know what kind of components we want to put in. Do we I mean, is it gonna be a multimedia control centre? Do we want to be able to use the video recorder with it? Yeah. True. But but we need good communication about this stuff, 'cause I have to f put the components into the design. So if I don't know what components to put in, it's kind of hard. Yeah so Okay. Yeah I I know what you mean, but you'll ne need several other buttons for a video player. You need a play and a forw fast forward and a stop function. And you you don't need that for a T_V_. And and for a t uh teletext you need additional buttons as well, so I kind of need to know what we uh need. Whatever, I'll just put my ideas in uh in here and then we can discuss it with the next uh meeting. Okay. Okay. Alright. Yeah. I understand. Yeah. Alright. Yeah. Thanks. Alright. See you later. What the
