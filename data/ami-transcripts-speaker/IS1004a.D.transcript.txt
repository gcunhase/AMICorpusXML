Hi I'm Guillermo. I'm the Marketing Expert. 'kay I dunno why, but when I was a child I I wanted to be a a panther not a pink panther, or maybe yes. Uh yeah yeah. Okay it's a friendly panther. Yeah maybe. Um. Actually, honestly I I I dunno what's what's his it's be behaviour, I dunno if if it's the male who who hunts or it's the female uh, I I I have watched that lions di didn't hunt it's the the female lions who who hunt, so but I like it because it's fast, and it's black as well, so it can he it can hide itself very easily and it's it's it looks like um powerful, strong, uh I dunno. I I watch a a film about a black panther when I was a child and I was in that age when everything was shocking me a lot. Okay. I like it. Yeah.
