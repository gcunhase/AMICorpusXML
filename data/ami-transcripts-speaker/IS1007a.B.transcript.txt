Hmm. Good morning. Mm. B did you send us an email about this? Yeah, we we received an email about this uh d designs. Ah it's Okay. Yeah, you see the email? You email. The v very no, no the first one. It's inside. No, no. The third one. Oh, you didn't get anything. It's strange. Mm. I got an email about the dis about the discussion. Yeah. I dunno from who. From the account manager. You have received the same email, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so each of us has a role to do. In each We already have our role. 'Kay, we can So there are three kinds of designs, that's all. Okay, alright. Yeah, yeah. I'm doing the interface. Are you using the you are doing the in Ah Okay. Mm? Um working on i. User interface. Yes. You see the second mail? Yeah, it's inside. Go down. Appendix. See there's a role for everybody. Even for the marketing. But look at your role, your marketing role. Yeah, that's your role. Mm. Yes. Mm-hmm. Need to collect information. Um. I I'm part of design, perhaps. Uh, what is most important in a in a remote control? What is the most important function aspect? Uh. That's alright. Yeah, it should be easy to work with. Yeah. Uh. We maybe you can have a speech uh recognition interface. You just tell the television I want which channel. Or or you can say for example, um I want uh to list all the programme tonight. Y you know, instead of uh remote control it's doing the some searching for you, so you don't have to look for the channel you want. Just say maybe I just want to press I wanna have a button for all the movies tonight. Or a button for all the magazines, all the information documentary tonight. And then you list a few, and I will choose from the list. So instead of pressing the channel number, I am choosing the programmes directly. Yeah, that's one way of uh making it useful. No, because no, it's not very a lot. Th this information exists. For example you can get um You can use uh well for example anything. The the idea of using speech to reduce the button, but uh and it's more natural. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes, possible. Yeah. But Yeah. Yeah, yeah. But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that um there should be a function, instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel, there's a option you can choose, either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme. So it's more powerful. Yeah. No. No, because you see now all the T_V_ programmes are available on the webs. They they are they are they are available in X_M_L_ format or whatever the format. We don't care. We just say that this are some content. We just want to retrieve the content and then classi sort them by the types of programmes. Some of the websites they already provide this service, so we can just use the service available. Download it uh to the to this remote control. And then there's there are only six buttons for six categories, or sev seven. The most there are only seven buttons. So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button, for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want, so you don't have to choose among hundred channels, if you have hundred channels, you just have six buttons, seven buttons. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Ah, yes. So. Yeah. Yeah, so you don't have to display here, just display on the T_V_ screen, right? Good idea. Okay. I think I think that will be revol revolutionary. Because all the T_V_ uh the the remote control have all numbers, lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end. Yeah. Alright. Okay. Ah w w we have sometimes to use the white-board. Five minutes. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but we are designing just remote control. Okay. Okay, do you want to have a conceptual remote control there, or you just want to put the function in? Go on, draw something. Mm. Where is it? Ah, okay. Where where is it? Here. Mm. Mm. Okay, alright. So so the most functional des mm the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content. Right? We agree on that, right? Uh, uh first one is to uh buttons i or it could be anything with buttons. Uh to choose uh content s or channels. So we have both. The user can choose w which one they want, right? By content or by channel. Choose by contents or by channels. So And then what did we say just now? Other than this. Okay, so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content. Challenge. Okay. Content. Okay, so these we have to work it out. So this one of the problem. And uh The main thing. Okay. Alright. Alright, okay. So we are we'll discuss it we will get some information in the next meeting, so for now we get uh the funct this is the functional designer? That's the first aspect. Right. We will get information and then we'll come back in.. Yeah, we'll come. Alright. Alright, okay. Thank you, mis
