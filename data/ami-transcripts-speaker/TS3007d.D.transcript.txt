Yeah, except for the buttons it's it could be a standard model. 'Kay, it's my time now. Okay. During the Oh. During the design uh design life-cycle we uh we made lot of requirements and trend analysis and stuff. Um, now is the time to uh evaluate our prototype concept to uh to the past requirements. So we are going to evaluate the design according to the past user requirements and trends analysis. Um, we're going to do that with a seven point scale. Opening a Word document now. Okay. One oh, okay, uh I have to expla explain something. We have to uh be consensive about about things. So, it has to be a group uh group decision. Okay? Uh We're going to vote. We yeah? The prototype. Yeah. Okay, one. The remote control is designed for people with age below forty. Seven is false. Yeah, b one or Most true? Yeah, so so a o one is appropriate? Or, more like a four. Three.

It's it's it doesn't really make a lot of Four? Yes, but five is between four and six. B_. Yeah, it it's Yeah, yeah. But but the survey under users was that they uh really lost it. Like, no not uh not seeing it, but lost it in the house or something. But, okay. Yeah, okay. Yeah, I I agree, I agree. Okay. Eight, the remote control has fresh, fruity colours. Yeah, yeah, not too flashy. The remote control is made of soft material. Three? Easy to use? Top easy to use? It's it's not the most easy to use It can be easier. Jus just with ten buttons, that's the easiest. Yeah, but the most uh easy to use is just with one button on t Yeah, okay, but easy n not not the most easy to use, I think. Two? We also have to compare it to the uh to the remote controls on the market nowadays. So Yeah yeah, I'm uh hurrying. Okay, eleven. The remote control is innovative. A very of course. The remote control has m remova removable from Multilux. The remote control, i it has speech recognition. False. The remote control has built-in games? Yeah. And the last, paren parental advisory function. Yes, I do. Save as. Okay, I will uh do the the math. Now it's your turn. No. Advanced chip. Advanced chip is three. Three Euros, yep.

That's another article to sell. That doesn't account for this. Producing this. No. Yeah. Yeah, of course. Yeah. Daniel. Daniel, what do you think about Here. What do you think about uh putting a battery in it, but also selling like uh the covers, a docking station just apart from the from the thing, so that you can uh put uh rechargeable batteries in it and just Yeah, yeah, okay. Just an idea. Yeah. Yeah, of course. Yeah. Yeah, Yeah. Hey, those ar arcs, why are there for? The blue blue uh Okay. No, no no. Yeah. But, wha 'Kay, look, what is the uh If you make it double-curved, it costs one Euro more. But No, but does it have a lot of extra uh fun function more like Yeah. Yeah, uh aesthetic. I mean, uh you make like eleven and a half Euros profit instead of twelve and a half. But I don't know if twelve and a half is uh a fixed uh fixed price. No, we can't go above that. Yeah? Yeah, okay. Then it's okay. Yeah. Yeah, I think so. Yeah. What a what about all the m the environment freaks? Not freaks, the envi No. I I think it's it's It look like this one. Yeah. Yeah. This is it. Ah no, we have to do all those hours again. Go back. One back? Costs on uh No redesign. Yeah. Yeah, okay, yeah. Hmm. I I didn't think so. That there was a lot of room for it. But, that's mainly because uh of the information that was delivered to us. It was just fixed information and get your stuff from there, and I couldn't go on on i on the internet and search my own stuff. Bu Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. Leadership was uh crappy. Okay. No, leadership was uh Okay, I thought uh the first meeting was a little bit of unstructured meeting. Uh, you could have but uh, it was your first, no uh no disrespect or something, but you could have uh structure it a l little bit more. So like, I I was talking most of the time the first meeting meeting, and Yeah. But About me. Yeah, you made up. No, it you did better. Yeah. Much more constructive. Two guys. Okay. Means. Digital pen, I thought uh th the first time I did individual work, I used it. But, a and the first two meetings I brought it with me, but I didn't use it at all after the first the first meeting. It's it's not real real use for me. Not really, no. Yeah, like when you do this. Smaller? Oh. Sorry. Okay. New ideas? Do you? Go on. Yeah. Mm, yeah, I think so. Did you heard what he said? I don't I don't know what I mean. Oh, I have some figure. Here. The eva the evaluation, the mm the mean uh number is uh one point eight one point eight six. So that's fairly uh fairly good, I think. Uh, that uh all the requirements uh are true or very true, right. Yep. Yeah. May maybe the idea you proposed is uh a screen here. And draw it, and it's it's placed over there. Hmm? No. Ah, very bad. But I think this is better than regular flip-overs, but Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but insert image isn't available? Here. Picture from scanner, clip-art. Hyperlink? Hey, what if you do like hyperlink? Type type it? Re Real Reaction dot N_L_. Yes, is now is okay. Okay? Huh. 'Kay, double-click it. You're erasing. Double-click it. Yeah. Yep. What I really miss also is uh is a d is a turtle is a decision uh decision system like um With the evaluation, you have to Polls like, what do you want, a one, a two, maybe a a l a little application like uh uh give your own number and click one two three four five six seven. Yeah, j ju ju yeah, v voting application. Just a little group group decision application. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Yeah, of course. But, uh you can still discuss about it, but but click it in an application, that's a lot easier to process. The digit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. That's it? Celebration. Yeah. Yeah. What is an end report? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Oh, you ha you have ten minutes left, I uh read. You have now ten minutes left to finish up the end report. Yeah. Um You you already made a beta version, or Pages. Okay, Daniel. Do you want a chair maybe? Hey? Oh, okay. Five minutes for finishing. Management Expert, you have to change that. Marketing. Yeah, but you can save it u the under another name. Maybe um the The Yeah. You Yeah. No, you have to put uh, switch channels uh at the top, because that's the most used function and teletext at the second Oh nay, a volume changing, second. S switch, yes. Yeah. Okay, go on. Yes, very good. Yeah. Yeah. The order. Single-curves. No, okay. Was initial, the plan. The initial plan. No, it's it's not very cheap, but that no, but it's a development inside corporation. Like, uh w we don't have to buy parental control. Our own people can make that, I think. Yeah, it it has some cost, but Yeah. Real Reaction. Okay. Still the end conclusion. That's all, I think. Yeah, but but the the decisions are put in the uh conclusion, I think. Why we decided to use a flat uh L_C_D_. Yeah. Um Save it. Hmm. Yeah, but then you had the same thing. Example of children remote. Oh wait. Wait. Hmm. That's a pity. You declare.
