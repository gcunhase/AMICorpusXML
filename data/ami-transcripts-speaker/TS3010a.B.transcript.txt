Hmm. That's uh strange. Yeah. Okay. Let's try this. Uh Um. Mm-hmm. Mm. Uh No, no. Yeah. Okay. Uh blank. No. Uh well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the T_V_ set. And that it controls the channels and the the volume. And uh I I I think it's positive if there's a a LED uh uh a LED on the corner of the of the remote. So that you know it s it still has batteries on it in it. And that if you push the button the LED uh gives a light, and uh and you see that it's working. And uh yeah. Uh Yeah, but No no no. But I my my experience is that it it it's convenient to have that. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah well that's that are good ideas. Uh Yeah well the LED on the corner, that that indicates that it's working. If you push a button. Um Yeah. And looking on the budget, not too expensive uh material. So probably plastic or something. Uh Mm no. Yes.
