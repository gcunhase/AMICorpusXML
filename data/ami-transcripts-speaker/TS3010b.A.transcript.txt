And Presentation of working design. Save as. Uh it's Project. Save. Very good. Okay. So Now have ten minutes to tell it. Okay. Oh oh. Two questions. The battery. You say one battery is cheaper. Why? Yeah but when you use two, you can use it two times longer. Okay so it's the size of the remote control. Okay and the buttons. When you use it on the television, you've you need the television, wh which can use it. S Okay. I think we have to use it also on other televisions though. So Yeah but I don't I think it They are two different things though. We have to choose one. It has to work on o uh all televisions. Okay. Yeah. Good idea. Mm-hmm. Yeah but there are much more Nokia telephones than um these ones. Yeah but are their profits bigger than their cost? Yeah but there are also design cost. I don't think When you have a remote control, do you change the cover? Would you change the cover? No. N yeah but I think that too less people would change it for good profit. So Yes it is but I don't think we have to do it. Okay. That's clear. Okay thank you. So now the User Interface Designer. We'll got back on that later. 'Kay, thank you. Then it's your turn, the marketing expert. Okay thank you. Yes. I think uh the L_C_D_ is cheaper than speech recognition. So I think that can be an d good option. L_C_D_. Yes. Only the L_C_D_. So But we'll come back on that. Now Oh, go on. What d d d um Um Uh we go back on the decisions later. Now we have a few new product requirements. First, teletext. We have internet now so we don't need the teletext anymore. So not necessary. Next. Only for the television. So we don't look at the other things like the radio or something. Only the television. Third. We look at the age group of forty plus. Uh no, younger than forty. Is a g big group, and like you showed, n not very much people buy our stuff. Fourth point. Our corporate colour and slogan must be used. Very important for the design. So you can see it on our site. Next. Um no. We have to make our decisions, what we want to do. So like you said, we need the. Maybe it's good to put it in a document. Now we have to decide what controls do we need. So maybe you can tell us. Sorry? Yes. Yes, it's okay. Yeah but we don't use it.

Zero to nine. Yeah that's the channel. Menu? Uh yes the n newer televisions ha do have menus. Uh M Menu. I think um the only one or two numbers. And Hello? That's ch Yes. On the L_C_D_ screen, you mean? Think it's better to have it on the remote control, 'cause it it has to work on all televisions. So we need N Yes. But if we have this So now we don't have a lot of buttons. Is this enough? Mute. Maybe in the menu? Mute. Mm-hmm. Okay. Maybe more? No. Well. Then that's all. This will be the buttons.
