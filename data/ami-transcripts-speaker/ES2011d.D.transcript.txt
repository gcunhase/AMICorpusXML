Um evaluation criteria. I've got a presentation. So I need where's the cable? Right what happens is we have to um decide whether this this whole this whole project we've been working on actually um meets the standards we were set at the start. Um. Right. This doesn't okay. Um the method is we well I've analysed the user requirements and integrated them to the trends found in marketing reports and in our company strategy marketing. And um the findings were that we need it to look in a certain way, feel in a certain way, and this is everything's listed down. Um, look in a certain way, feel in a certain way, it has to be technologically innovative and it has to be easy to use. These are all things we looked at at the start, um and criteria that have to be met. We have to use a table, I'll show you that later, together to decide whether it meets the standards. And we we have therefore in total um We have five we have eleven points according to which this should be evaluated. And um the cri well basically the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria. I would like to show you the table we have to use. Um. No. This is the table. Can you see this here? Um so the que the questions I've given you c could you write that down? True is one and and false is seven. And we'll just go through each point together, hopefully. Um. I think if each of us gives an opinion then they can be mixed somehow. I dunno how it works exactly, I haven't been told. Yeah it's in the um it's in the project documents. It's called evaluation criteria. And it's under evaluation. Yeah. You've found it all? So it was um Yeah true's one. Do you want us to discuss this together or do you want us to do it singly? Yeah okay. Um, yes it's if it's fancy you put one, if it's really unfancy it's seven. Yeah, something. They shouldn't really be questions. Should be more like Are the batteries easy to insert? Yes? Very very true. Okay. Okay. Apparently I'm supposed to use the whiteboard. Do we um is it necessary? We'll just do um Yeah. Okay. I don't feel any right um Right so one point one? We'll just go in a circle. Right. Ooh I don't know. Right. One? Five. Two. Okay so do we just add it up and divide it by four? Is that what the company does? Yeah? Oh no. It adds to thirteen. One five five two. One five five two is thirteen, over four for now. I think that's um next? Really? Two. Uh-oh. Right. One point three is Yeah. I really Well uh Yeah yeah. It was one is true and false is seven. I should've kept the table up. Right, well I'm glad this came out. Yeah. No. Oh that's quite funny. Okay. Okay. So, starting again, one point one? Two. Okay, one point two? Two. Okay. Um, one point three? Ha. Two point one? Yeah. Oh dear, okay. Sorry. Two and one. Sorry about that. T two point two, which is one point five. Okay. Three point one. Is that correct on my slide? Yeah? One, four, three, three, three point two? Three point three. Four point one? Two. Four point two. Two and four point three. One, two. Right so I put one on that. Okay I'll um I'll just do the calculations now if you want to continue. Or is it tedious? I'm I'm sorry this was so tedious for everyone. I didn't know how else to do it. Okay. Well the worst ones were three point one. Do does every ones have the slide? Three point one. Slide show. Material technologically innovative, okay. Um, do you want to change it? What are the suggestions? I don't know, anyone? Yeah that it's three point one was not that good. Four point one. The shape. Four point two? Yeah. That looked really good. Are there any fruits that look like broccoli, no? I think that broccoli is my favourite actually. Uh despite the Yeah. Yeah and just have the colour match or something. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um Think the critical ones came out to be yeah that one.. Batteries easy to insert for some reason, which can be easily I think that's not a problem any more. No. I think everyone's under three anyway. So I think it's yeah those are the only two points. Yeah. Do you want this and we can all No. It's alright yeah? Yeah. Yeah we didn't we uh it all c sort of blended quite well. Which isn't very user-friendly though. I though it was brilliant no? No mine was really helpful as in my stuff was quite helpful I think. I think it depends on the role no? Yeah. But it must have been quite difficult for them to build a whole um a whole system, 'cause of course they can't give you uh uh anything comparable to the internet for the Yeah, yeah. No. But I think that it it might be to see whether people actually all come up with the same thing. Yeah, like if everyone's given the same input I don't have a clue, anyway. Um what's next? Looks like oh no that's not um It's quite Yeah. Yeah it's all very new, no? It's all very new. Sorry. What what's the end? Are we are we supposed to um you supposed to write a report? Or we ending? Is that the end? End of meeting. You have to tell her, she Okay we have to fill in all this stuff. Stuff stuff stuff. Yeah. Well there's al eight, nine. Ooh. Oh ooh.
