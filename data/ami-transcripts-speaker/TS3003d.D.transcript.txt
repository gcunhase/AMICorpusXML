Good afternoon. Sorry I'm a little late. Got stuck in the traffic. Yeah. Um, is this the moment where we ask or can ask questions about the functionality? Um, when you're in teletext there usually are buttons where you just you just press it and you g go to the next teletext page. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Um Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Think so. That's what I pointed out earlier. If you just make a control for just the T_V_ there's just not much to gain here. Since it rechargeable. Um Damn. Wouldn't Yeah. No. That wouldn't be an option. Uh, d I assume you'd count the volume and channel thingies for two buttons each, right? Well, think actually there're two buttons, aren't they? Well I was thinking, maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button. That would cut the cost. Mm-hmm. Yeah. But, I think this really is four buttons anyhow. Yes. Only the docking station, I guess. Maybe we should to a different supplier. Yeah. Yeah, that's what I'm wondering. Um Well, since the market research indicated that older people spend their money easier, more easy, maybe it's feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little. Especially since we have those nice features. It would be a be a pretty rigid one. Or b Basically becoming a choice between like either a good remote and a higher production cost, or just any other remote control. But how does scroll-wheel work here? That would bring up the price of the scroll-wheel also. Integrated scroll-wheel push-button. But Yeah. I think that would be like the end of our usability. Yeah, but Well, think it's pretty much the teletext subtitles are right now you just push the teletext button, go to page eight eight eight, and teletext disappears. But the subtitles stay there. I think that's the case on most Well, that could be just uh like the scroll to eight, click, scroll to eight, click, scroll to eight, click. But then again that would be d j just pretty much not an option for older people, who don't even know what a scroll-wheel is. Holding a remote with which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero. With only five buttons on it. And a scroll-wheel. True. True. That's a pretty big scroll wheel. So this is five buttons. Right now we have five. Mm. Well, I still think we should go for the single curve design. But then again, all these changes are not really okay with me. But since we just have to. I'd rather just go to the board and get us to spend eighteen dollars a a remote. Or do some market research and see what the options are. Yeah. Yes. Definitely. Yeah. It's pretty different. But this is not really like for the group we were making our remote. This will really require a lot of marketing to get this to sell. 'Cause if older people like familiar forms and familiar stuff. This is not familiar for them. So we're gonna have to do a lotta convincing them. Yeah. That's true. Might uh might be confusing too. They'd be like, what? Only five buttons? Yeah. But you're not sixty. Mm-hmm. So um, I like set up all these criteria. And evaluation of the thingy. Thank you. Five more minutes? Okay. 'Kay so I did some literature study study, and analysis of the requirements we set up earlier. Translated it into criteria, which would be these. Um, is the remote fancy? The shape, look and feel. Innovative? What new functions are there? Uh, easy to use? Uh, learnability is a very important factor here. Uh, is it functional? Are there not too many functions uh among the functions? And are the those functions that are there, are they useful? And the cost. The target group. Is the remote really for the group we're making it for? And recognability. If our company is If it is easily recognisable that our company made it? And So we're supposed to evaluate it right now. Let's see. Oh I have to say this was a little hard, because the minutes of our last meeting were not here. Okay. Interesting. So Is the design fancy, on a scale of one to seven? We all go for six? Good. Um, is the design innovative? I think so, with our L_C_D_ screen, docking station, scroll-buttons. Seven? Should be do-able. Is the design easy to use? Well Would be for us. But I'd go for four, too. Is the design functional? Um, do we have all functions that we want to include? I think we do. Do we have too many functions? I don't think so. It's pretty slim. Seven. Oh, and do we um take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control? Like it getting lost and R_S_I_ influences? Think we do. Are the production costs within the preset limits? Well they are now. Does the design fit the group of focus? Yeah. I think it doesn't. I don't know. I think I think a radio button is not exactly what older people expect to have a remote control. I'm not sure. I think I'd go for two. 'Kay. Is the company company recognisable? Well, we have the logo there. So Yeah. So that will be this. I was also supposed to calculate the score, but thought we would have another private thingy after this. Is this Like after this, are we done? Or We're gonna go to our other room again. Well, anyhow. These are seven factors times seven is forty something. Two? No. Nine? Uh, minus one. Minus three, minus four. Minus four. So that would be minus eight. Forty one out of forty nine. Okay. Guess I'll just type that in on the bottom here. Hmm. 'Kay. So that will be the evaluation. Think we should have a should have had the finance thingy a lot earlier. In the design phase. Yeah. Definitely. No. Not too much. No. Yeah, true. But And I would've liked to go for the younger users also. And just to be able to access internet and get something of your own. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I tried to open the file on my laptop, but not possible. Yeah. no. Should've done that then. Pen is here. Mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. They are. Yeah. Fifty grand. Yeah. Yeah, still I think I mean if we're n gonna make a scroll-button anyway it'd be more for the younger people than for the older people. So maybe we should just re-focus. Or specifically for younger people. That's true. Yeah, I think then it would be way more uh popular with younger people than it is, than would be with older people. Even if it were their covers. But Party party. 'Kay. Oh you did. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, it probably will. Oh yeah, you're supposed to make a final Are we supposed to go into our own rooms again? Yeah. Yeah. That'd be nice.
