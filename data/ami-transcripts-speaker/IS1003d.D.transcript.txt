No not really. Just Crap. Okay. 'Kay, so whe where is the remote control? Yep. What slides? Yeah. Yeah, because mushroom was not in the trends. I mean there was fruits yeah. Yeah. I don't think it is. Mm-hmm. Yeah. But anyway this is not a mushroom anyway, so it's fine. No, I mean, yeah yeah. Inspira inspiration is True. But we say uh we sa we said solar. Yeah. I mean, we gonna try to measure how good it is instead of just talking about uh we had three keys key points to uh for this remote control design, and first one was uh fancy look and feel. So w we'll try to judge this feature uh with a one to seven scale, one being uh no, I think. Uh just let me check. One one being true, and seven being false. Okay. Ouch. So Do we have a fancy look and feel, according to you? But is it Uh I'll agree it's unique, but is it really Yeah I mean, fancy was was defined by s fruit and vegetable look. Yeah. I dunno where the lemon is, but I mean it's not obvious. If I dunno, maybe improving the texture of like having it less smooth or Yeah. I dunno. Yeah, it's getting Okay. Yeah, that's Wait th that's the second point. First one is we have to judge the fancy look and feel. I mean No, the colour is okay, that's fine. I mean it's but I would say there is more too much red. Um if Right. So, from one to seven? No, seven is false and one is true. Three? Okay. Three. Then uh let me The other criterion is is it technologically uh technologically in innovative. Yeah bu but when you say technologically it's more uh I dunno, in the core, or single. Mm-hmm. No, that's good. Yeah. Yeah, th that's another really good point. Maybe okay. So using the same scale, two? Okay. Now maybe the most critical one. L last one w I would like to judge is is it easy to use? Yeah but this this turning can you can you just re explain me the Please. Yeah. Yeah but how how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels? Like if you want to go from Yeah but imagine you y Yeah I'm I'm no I'm not definitely convinced it's it's the best way to if you wanna jump from, I dunno, one to twenty? How can you go directly to twenty, for example? Yeah. Yeah. I agree. I agree. But I mean if you're fro from two? Yeah ju just imagine you have fifty fifty channels uh We're not talking Yeah. Yeah. How d how do you know this angle is th is the correct one? So you you count one degree, two degrees, no. I don't think so. Yeah voc vocal command is okay. But w we've said previously that maybe it's not going to be th l the main And this would be more for browsing, ah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I mean you're famous. You. Mm. Okay the uh th this looks better. Yeah. Yeah, but it has to be on to recognise fas Ah, that's not the ecological part, yeah. Solar. So, which number? So reasonably, is four, is one? So, three. Uh we wouldn't say, I mean, those are sort of agreed but this one would be more five to me. I'd like I mean this is the just a prototype. I'm not really convinced it's so easy to use, but I don't know. Yeah. So you have yeah. Uh by pushing zero after after the first one. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, if you're changing your mind. Fine to coarse. Okay. But this this has to stay on the table, right? This has to stay on the table. Yeah but then uh when you turn turn it Just It's Yeah. You know tha that's the weak point, because with a traditional one you just have one hand. Sure. Yeah, you would never you would never lose this one, yeah. Yeah. Four. Uh it's even easier to maybe. Ok Mm. So, average? Three? Okay, so Yeah, especially on the easy to use target. Okay. Mm-hmm. No. So we are all already nineteen. Yeah. That's gonna be double curved, yeah. Rather four buttons. Oh no, interface. Yeah, yeah that's special colours, sure. Yeah tha that's wheel. Yeah. I think the price is okay. Um, no. Yeah w one of the m key point is solar cells. Yeah. No y i it did change, but just imagine we have Yeah. Yeah but this one one of the feature we were not really Yeah. Yeah, if Yeah. Yeah, that's one of the requirement. We could turn we could turn everything in either yellow or black. Black then is a regular colour, so. Yeah, one. Yeah. So push button then it's it's the next expensive one. Yeah, thi this might be. Close to. Okay, so what's the bottleneck? Double curved. Yeah, but flat Case, what's the ca And then one Euro left. Um. Um So we have one button, one wheel. It's good they're not charging anything for that. Yeah y actually it's wrong. We're not under twelve Euros and a half. Okay. Okay. Solar cells. Yeah. That's nice argument, but if it's it's still four our of twelve. Yeah. Yeah but we just have one button. Easy. I don't know about powerful. Yeah. Mm. Uh that's what we've just done. Yeah. Um okay. Well I think we have just have to discuss if I dunno. Uh tha that was good but we should have more brainstorming like meetings, maybe. 'Cause we just presenting one is presenting his stuff next one his stuff and then we try to combine afterwards, so it um. Yeah, but just don't trust too much the trends. 'Cause fruit and vegetables it won't last for ten years uh. Maybe two years it's dead. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but this is good because it's not a long long life product. T_V_ is more like fifteen years, maybe, so. If you have a lemon lemon T_V_ for fifteen years Yeah, yeah. Tha that would that would make it. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. It's party party remote control. Yeah. Uh-huh. Twenty five Euros. Yeah, I think it's It's cheap, yeah. No, I I'm not so happy about the fruit shape, you know. Yeah. No, the colours are uh it's perfect, yeah. True. Uh yeah, another thing is the logo is missing still. Uh Still that was one of the requirements we had. It's yeah but it I don't think it's such a problem just putting the logo somewhere. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Cute na You cannot say mushroom because it's not the trend. It's not the trend. Yeah, but just flying saucer, or I would say flying saucer. It's more appropriate, somehow. Mm. Mm. Yeah but that's going to be expensive, you know. We had some problems going to twelve Euros and uh I dunno. Yeah, afterwards, if if it's a new trend. Okay. We should celebrate. Mm. Yeah. Our final prototype which yeah.
