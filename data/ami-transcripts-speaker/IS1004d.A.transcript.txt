Okay. Good afternoon again. So we should have our final meeting about the detail designed of detail design of the product of the remote control. Um So here is the agenda for today. Uh uh just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last last uh meeting then we have a p presentation of prototype of you two, sounds interesting. And we'll have um presentation of evaluation crit criteria by ou our Marketing Experts. Then we'll have to go through finance evaluation of the of the cost of the thing and um hopefully uh we should fit the target o tw of twelve point five uh uh Euro. Okay. So let's go. Uh if I go quickly through the minutes of the last meeting. So we went through th uh w we took this following decisions. No L_C_D_, no speech recognition technology, okay, we went through a b to a banana look and feel for the remote control. We went through the use of wheels and but buttons. And also the use of a basis station for battery ch charging and uh also to um call the to call the mot mote remote control when it is lost. Okay. Um. Good. So guys let this uh wonderful thing. Oh yeah. Sorry. Um. Which is Yeah can you show it to the the camera maybe. Mm-hmm. What's the use uh of the t turbo button already? Ah yeah yeah an then you stop when you stop it stops. Uh-huh. Which one? Okay. To navigate it through th through teletext. with the wheel it's easy. Excellent. Calling. Excellent. And the the leaves plays the roles of of antennas? Oh. Great. So, what else? Yeah, they're light. Ah yeah. So for the power source, apparently you still you you want to use both solar cells and batteries. Uh you mean okay. So Yeah, where are going to where are you are you going to place them? You have enough surface? You Okay. What will be the autonomy? Roughly? The autonomy. Autonomy. Uh I mean how long does i how how how long can it be held off a station? Yeah. A long Yeah, so it's It's used only when you Yeah. F weeks. Right. Next slide? Okay. Okay. Those really sounds very good. Nothing else to add? Yeah. Well in fact b both will be could be useful, navigating through teletext. Yeah. Wow. Very good uh yeah you th yeah. Bananas everywhere. Okay, so So we have to go through now evaluations. So your slides are ready? Uh you're four I think. So this is one, which one is this one? Num number So to have in order to have enough granularity it's in order to have enough granularity in the evaluation. Okay. Okay. Yeah, six. S seven. Six. No, wait. What do you say seven? Five? Okay, six point five. Handy? Seven. So seven, seven, six, six point five. Functional. Four. Uh for a remote control, does he have all the you could expect. Yeah. So it's universal but for T_V_s. So s uh four? Five? Four. Four. Okay cool? Cool device. Yeah. Seven. Six. Plus six, I say I said seven. So it's six. Yeah. Seven. Seven. And you? Outl you are not lik outlier. Seven Okay okay okay okay. Of course I'll buy the banana. Well Twenty five Euros. Cheap. Yeah, so the target price is for all Europe, or only for rich countries? It's more targeting U_K_ or So this is selling costs, not production costs. Yeah yeah sure. Um Five. Aw, should be nice in your It's kitsch. Well, don't forget well, don't for don't forget who we're targeting also who are f f who are wh yeah, youngst youngst No well yeah I if you would be young. Not telling that you are young. Li li like a teenager for instance. Okay you're you're crazy teenager and you like fun things. Yeah. Yeah, you want to show the beautiful banana you have. Okay so you s you give oh yeah yeah I know I know. So you say two. F I d I say five. You say? So what's the new question? Uh yeah, I think so. Yeah that's two different question. Ugly. I stick to five. W we have six, five Three So we are six, five, four Yeah. So So and last question, will I change my rem change my remote control from Mando banana. Um, zero. No uh we can't. So one. Well if. No uh let's say I'll put two. It's for the T_V_. Two three five two three fi and two. So it's r Yeah, three point five. No no you say five, he is the outlier. Okay just just do a sum. Well maybe we should we should uh have a look globally glob Yeah. So maybe maybe w we can we should stick to general feeling. We can had uh have a out of these numbers, which which is that well we should go for it. Problem with connectors? Okay. So let's move uh let's move on. Okay, now now we have to mm to estimate uh the cost okay. So I prepare an Excel sh uh an Excel sheet. Um well we are going to calculate the production costs. We should we should be below twelve point five. So I already uh put some pu some numbers here, okay. We are going to go through so this is the number the mm number of components we need for this thing. So it appears that there were things that we didn't thought about. Uh and also things that I uh I d I forget to uh to put like solar cells. Oh yeah finally we say no. Okay so let's let's go let's go let go through all the lines. So hand dynamo. This something we didn't thought about. But Yeah. Yeah. Okay so we we stick to battery, one. No kinetic also. I don't I don't see the difference between kinetic and dynamo. Ah you have to ah okay I see so kinetic is really uh shaking the banana. Crazy. Okay. So those banana is falling. Let's go ahead. So we we st only have one for battery. Uh then for electronics um so I didn't put anything for the. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. No so we hin Yeah so one. Ooh ye ye ye the cost is increasing. So we are The beep. That's what Okay so I'll remove it. S So don't we need a Oh there is no listing for r radio frequency thing. So Yeah maybe. We'll see later. Okay so in for the case um I put single curved. Because we have two things. No. Well. What a what i if I put one here. Yeah so let's put one here in the then instead of single oka all right. So we stick to plastic, it cost nothing. No, it's too no. It's too expensive. We're already at eleven. Okay so I put rubber one. Okay so special colour, yellow. Uh for the interface we have We have three. No no. We have two scroll, and we have three push buttons. And No it's no chip. This is just radio frequency. Th This is no chip. It's just Yeah. No. Just only. Okay w we didn't think a thought about uh integrated scroll wheel push buttons. Yeah, so Yeah. Okay. So no L_C_D_, so for we have no button supplements, right? Uh well in fact could we could not we consider this button as a button supplement because oh no, these are these are for colours, co and special forms, special colours and special materials. So Okay so we are over budget. Yeah. Yeah. So mayb in fact n we have to put two here because it cost nothing. Exactly exactly so we have margin for that stuff. Yeah maybe. Okay good. Wha Excellent. Um we'll invest in R_ and D_. Yeah. So well we're under the the the cost. So we can go to through to project evaluation. Sorry? Which is different. Which is different. None of us will buy it. This is a battery. This is what we which you can mm It did yeah. Extra battery, yeah. Exac Well in fact I I did not know I didn't know really what to say here. If uh if you have any ideas of what we can we can say. So I don't I don't I don't understand what what they mean by satisfaction um and for and for example. Should it be more like um like a status of of the these meetings in fact. Yeah well in fact uh we we use a little bit the white board and the digital pen, not that much. Oh yeah it's really creative. Yeah. Yeah maybe we should go through, yeah an uh evaluation. So maybe you should we should do a kinda evaluation in the streets like asking to young peoples well, do you like to have a banana as a remote control. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yep. Any any new ideas we could uh we could investigate next time? Dunno, oranges? Hmm. Okay. Very good. So Well done. I think we we can go home. Yeah. Maybe maybe we can hassle the the production department to to make a a real prototype that we can use at home to to evaluate. Okay so thanks very much. Bye.
