Okay. Mm. Mm-hmm. Uh okay. Um I've been looking at uh the user interface of it. Um f for the techno f functions uh of of it. Um Okay. Mm? Oh. Uh. Okay. Um yeah. I think uh we uh must use the general functions uh of the uh remote control. Uh uh I've do I've uh done a little uh research on the internet and not much information about it, Um about uh interface but uh Uh Yeah I I've been thinking about a simple manner uh to put a lot of functions uh uh in one um in one uh remote control. Uh so uh you've got a lot of devi uh devices like uh D_V_D_ uh uh television, uh stereo. So um But uh it must be uh user-friendly. So um uh you c you can't put a a lot of uh functions uh in one uh Yeah. Uh uh uh Yeah. In one um remote control. But um Yeah. Um yeah. Got uh many functions in one uh remote control, um but um yeah you can see, this is uh quite simple uh remote control. Um few uh buttons but uh This uh re uh remote control got a a lot of uh buttons. Um uh people uh don't like it, uh so um Well what uh I was uh thinking about was um uh keep the general functions uh like they are. So uh like uh the on-off uh button. Uh keep it uh yeah l like a red button. Uh everybody everybody knows it so uh uh you don't have to change that. Um My personal uh preferences um. Use a display for uh specific uh functions of the different uh device. So um Wh what I was th uh thinking about was um you've got um Uh this the remote control uh and uh you got here the general functions, uh like uh the on-off button uh sound uh I dunno um And um here you've got a s kind of a display. It's a touchscreen. So um yeah you got a general f uh f the functions of the device uh for a D_V_D_ player or uh so um the pl yeah um f for uh playing uh reverse uh. And um you got here uh real buttons for uh selecting uh a device. So um this button is for a D_V_D_ or So um for every um device you've got a uh a f a b a part uh display of a part buttons. So uh you you never got uh all the buttons uh on w one device. So uh that's uh my uh idea about it. Um yeah and Uh let's see. Uh yeah. So a touchscreen. Uh and um th the buttons uh the real buttons uh we have to use um. We better c um uh use uh quite uh large buttons uh for um yeah. Everybody uh have to use it so Uh ol even even old people um young people. So uh we must keep uh buttons uh quite s uh simple and quite large. So uh Um Yeah. Uh yeah. That was uh my uh part of it. So N I I don't think so. Uh you got uh quite a cheap uh touchscreen. S um it's uh not uh in colour or something. Uh it's just uh um one colo Uh yeah. Uh I seen uh w uh something on the internet uh not today but uh a few uh weeks ago. Uh you got uh yeah quite an uh a kind of uh touchscreen um and it's uh for uh twenty uh Euros or uh less uh. So it's possible. Yeah. Yeah that's true. Uh. Okay. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Mm. forty Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm. Yeah. But um deaf people need uh teletext for uh for subtitles. So it's Yeah. It's Mm. Yeah yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If it's only for televi Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So we can s we can skip the display, so uh we don't need it. Uh Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Hmm. No. No. No. Hmm. Mm. Hm. No. Mm. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Mm. No. So 'Kay. Yeah. Right. No. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
