You all saw the newsflash? Or you got the same message? Yeah sorry. Yeah. Yeah I received an email so I thought I I can't mail you so I thought I'd just drop it in the folder, but Is it unlocked? Woah. I uh kind of opened it. Uh Okay. 'Kay. Everybody ready? No no no. Yes yes yes. Okay. 'Kay. Can we get started or is there some pressing issue? Oh no pressing. Did you plug in the power cable when you come back? Yeah. That's difficult. Yeah. Yeah. Format save. Yeah. Oh yeah sure. You have Playstation also? Huh. Okay. So there we are again. Yeah. Okay this is the agenda. Um we have three presentations, I heard. Yeah really. So who wants to start? Yeah. Uh this is you? 'Kay. Yeah. often. Next generation does. N not used anymore. Yeah. Yeah. Not by mail. I receiv the mail but you don't. So That's in the presentation, so Uh below I believe. Yeah below forty. Mm-hmm. Our current customers are in the age group forty plus. And the new product should reach new markets, which is the customers below forty. That's in a newsflash. Yeah. But it also needs to have corporate identity. Present and the colours. So we can't change much of that. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. 'Kay. It's open already so you can use to find yours. F_ five. Go Jurgen. You pressed alt F_ four? Oh great. Yeah. Uh maybe you can do it from your computer so talk us through it. Yeah. That's nice. F_ five. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. The mm yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So n it's very easy. Now yeah it's okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah so maybe you can hide them or something. Yeah you make a screen menu or something. Mm-hmm. Yeah and the other oth other uh functionality is the screen. What does the screen do? Yeah. It's low power. So what does the screen do? They said they needed it but what does it do? What do they want with the screen? Yeah that's what we make it up. So but what did the marketing No. Yeah okay it's handy. With no predefined uh We're back online. Okay. Mm-hmm. Content and form. Yeah. That was the end. Okay. Uh which one is it? Technical functions? This one? Functional requirements? No. You didn't put it in? Or it's not really English. Uh kick off. Oh working design I got it. Here you go. Just uh press uh yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Design yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah decoder. Blank. Yeah okay. Work harder. Yeah. Uh 'Kay. Um for those that didn't see yet um the basic new requirements of the management were no teletext, only for T_V_. Uh it should be designed for a use g uh group below forty, but I don't think it's w wrong if we can uh target the current customer group as well. And uh the corporate identity should be clear in the design of the remote control. And we have to decide on the functions, and on the, let's see what was it, uh the target group. We have to make be clear what that is. Yeah users. Yeah so I think it's easy but Yeah it's below forty so we can decide where to Okay. So below forty is okay. But we need an lower level which to s uh focus. So is it from sixteen to forty? Is it from twenty to forty? Is it from thirty? Yeah? 'Kay. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Design. Mm. Mm-hmm. And maybe y Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So is you should have a menu for all the the functions you don't use regular and which are Yeah. Aye yeah. Shall I uh Yeah. It's okay. no, it doesn't have line control, so Yeah we get the The remote, yeah? Basic. Is on top. Which should be easy, easily reached with the thumb. T I s should said right. Because yeah. Mm-hmm. Do the also with the thumb. So it should be a little bit longer so that you can put your uh thumb, also reach the middle. Or you should screen at the bottom and then you can see it very clearly. You you need to be able to hold it so Yeah. Yeah okay that's true. Layout. That's for the I can't help it. Yeah. Man. Yeah okay. You want the normal piece of paper? And you have a pen? Yeah? Mm-hmm. Uh. And the for flipping up and down. Yeah. And left to right. And those can also be used for the menu. Yeah. Yeah okay but this is function so if you can use them for multiple things For the menu. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah but that depends on where you put the screen. But it's essential that there is a screen. Yeah. And for the speech uh recognition part, if we want to incorporate that, we need a microphone. Yeah. This would be uh No that's not s sure so uh we need a display. Yeah. Yeah they're used to it. Mm-hmm. Yeah but then it's possible that you cover it with your hand so I think that top is the best option. Yeah okay. Depends on the sensitivity of the microphone, but I think that's okay. Volume. Up. Channel up and down, and the control of the advanced options. So maybe it, we should decide what advanced options we want to put in the L_C_D_ screen. Yeah so sounds? Yeah and they're They're not used often so Yeah just Yeah sounds. Yeah. Of course. I'm just a secretary. Coffee? Treble bass. Uh Pitch I believe, yeah. Yeah. Yeah and mono stereo. Mm. And also the tuning part? Yeah programming. So channel programming? Mm. Yeah. Contrast yeah. Mm. No. Uh, so contrast, bright, uh And the others were in your presentation right? So I can just copy those? Okay. It's easy. Yeah the button options and the L_C_D_ options. Indeed. Yeah. Yeah you have basically a button menu, which you can use directly, uh according to the old principle. And the L_C_D_ options are activated by some some software options, thats communicates with the infrared uh decoder yeah. So you You have an additional processor and and software part. Compared to o Mm-hmm. L_ s Yeah. Colour. Yeah I I call it contrast. Yeah I make it c colour. Yeah. Yeah and automatically um Mm-hmm. Yeah so I've g channel program is autoseek? Uh name a channel, or Oh they get automatic names, okay.. Yeah. Yeah but can you also say I want f uh Veronica on the channel number uh five or Yeah. Yeah. How do you call that? Channels? Yeah. Ninety nine or something. Yeah. S swap channels? Can I call it that? Swap's good option. Okay. Uh other functions? Mm-hmm. Okay. Well that's 's up to uh Mister User Interface Designer. Also. That's you're Yeah but also, which buttons you have to press to get a certain result? And the working design was to specify how ph the physical interation between the components was, as I believe. No I don't think so. But I think the communication with the television is difficult. But that's not our part. We don't have to design a protocol so No that's the Yeah. So but Um The User Interface Designer can design a menu for all these function I put them on the. Yeah. Yeah I can. I'll just try to reorganise uh things. Um So you design the basic function menu for the L_C_D_ screen? Uh um I think th I think the yeah the layout of the screen and I think you can concentrate more on the button placement and the placement of the uh screen itself on the. No I d I think that's more in. Yeah. Okay. So he's layout and you're function. Form function okay. Yeah. I think i that's your department yes, because w he already knows what Yeah. But we're not allowed. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah and also make clear which buttons to press to get certain result, because that's always the difficulty. Every device has its own Menu okay. Yeah. Mm. Back. Yeah. Yeah but they're incorporated? Up and down is Smart? Put it on top. Mm-hmm. Well But that's uh J Jurgen's department. You just make the layout. You do we do the extra two buttons or not? Yeah. Yeah okay. That's true. And to, okay and back, also. And of course the four arrows. But those are still y doubly used. Both the L_C_D_ Yeah. Menu button access the menu in the L_C_D_ screen. You can navigate. But you can also navigate the channels. And the volume. Those are both both yeah. Oh five minutes. Light uh Yeah sure. Okay. Um Anything else? I've Volume. Well we have those buttons. We use all four. Yeah okay go ahead. Yeah that was already decided. Okay that's what we decided earlier on. Right okay. So yeah I wanna close down. I have to, sorry. it's not because I don't like you but yh we have lunch break, and then we can work for thirty minutes, and I have to write very fast to make the minich min minutes. And then uh we'll see I don't know. Nobody told me. No I th believe there's first lunch break. Yeah. Or you can just Yeah? 'Kay. I think you can put uh the laptop back in the room and 'Kay. Yeah it's a lot of pressure. That's okay. Oh yeah. I don't know if it works but it should be saved. Yeah. It's uh Should be here. Smart board. Don't know if you can use it but Yeah. I try to organise it by these three. Yeah yeah yeah. I don't really mind. I just put the minutes here and we'll see. Yeah that's in the functional design uh folder. Yeah. Yeah that's just basically what I just showed. Yeah. Yeah I got it by yeah. I'm gonna get kicked if I don't do it so Make me proud. Yeah. I believe so. just ask.
