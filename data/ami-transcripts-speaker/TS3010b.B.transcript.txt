Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah it's a good idea. But If if it Yeah, I don't I'm not sure if it will make profit enough to uh But it's uh yeah it's uh original idea. No. Oh. That's me. Uh Come on.. Ah. Yes well uh uh I shall give a short talk about the the technical function design. Um I thought the the the technical function design was uh to uh for a remote control to to to have some influence on the T_V_ set. Uh both audio and vide video uh in a cordless way. No cords attached. And uh well, it all by pushing a button on the remote. That was from my own experience and uh and uh the previous meeting. Uh I find some uh some interesting quotes on the web. Uh well the same idea here. Uh message to the television. And uh and and and well basic uh operations like on and off, and uh switching channels, and uh and maybe uh teletext or something like that. Uh well these are two uh remotes, and that's our uh our dilemma I think. Uh We just heard from the Industrial Designer how uh difficult it is. But uh shall we make a basic remote control, uh just uh swapping channels and volume and uh power button and well nothing much more. Or uh uh more functions on the remote. Uh maybe more devices you can influence. Uh a radio or a v a video recorder, uh V_C_R_. Yeah well that's our dilemma. Um any ideas about that? Basic or multifunctional? Okay yeah. Yeah well the that was just on my mind. So uh I didn't know what uh what way we would go. Mm yeah well that was my uh functional uh talk. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. No. And I don't uh I don't think twenty five Euros for a remote is really cheap or something. So it's Yeah, it's hard to uh get the younger group. Mm-hmm. Just the L_C_D_? Mm-hmm. Well a power button? Uh the well um I think separate channels. So But then both the the separate channels. So so uh zero to nine or something. Uh volume. Oh mine. Technical. Mm yes. Mute. Um Yeah but then it's always uh more than one uh thing to do.
