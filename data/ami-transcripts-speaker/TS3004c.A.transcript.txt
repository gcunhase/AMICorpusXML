Hello. Oop. Okay. Okay, we're just going to the later. So we're going to talk about the conceptual model. So that's me. Uh okay. So Uh okay. Okay, so I just show you the m the no mm mm the the the the the the minutes, minute. What's it called, I dunno. Whatever. Okay, so we just talked about uh Oh you want me to show that there or Okay, we just talked about it looks. Has to look nice. Usability is very important. People don't want to spend money on something that's similar to cheaper ones. Um It has to be very basic, not too many buttons. Light switches on if you use a button. Uh text T_V_ still has to be a possibility. And it has to be easy to learn. That were the things I uh make minutes of. And the functions are volume, channel to choose channels, an on-off, a mute uh button, and a text T_V_ button. That are the functions. That right? Okay. So I just want to give you uh Mike again, the first uh presentation of your Yeah. But we already have the flashing flashing light on the Okay. Yeah. Hmm. But maybe th that's al definitely a good idea, because you've you're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground. So it has to be flexible. That's a good That's a good idea. If it's de like that. That's good, a good idea. Is it a bit like like the the the the remote control? R_ soft. Okay. Yeah. It's very uh difficult to to to do it. Because it's only twelve and a half Euros you have to spend on every remote control. Okay. But that's definitely more expensive than Yeah, but a telephone Okay, yeah. But a telephone also have a L_C_D_ and and it's about t two hundred Euros. So uh Yeah, just modern modern but still uh basic. Yeah, maybe the teletext tel No. Yeah. Yeah. But it sounds very difficult to use. Because um the volume and channel is on the on the the bottom of it. So you can't use your thumb for it. Yeah, down there. But it's not not the best best. Yeah, for volume. For volume, or a channel. Yeah, why not. And the channels as well. Oh yeah. Yeah, that's better. Yeah, just th th th other buttons like text T_V_. Put that on the button bottom. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Except from the on-off button. Yeah. Yeah, that's cool. Okay. We have to decide this this lecture, or this this this uh fifty minutes, yeah, how it is gonna look. Okay, so Hmm, okay. Yeah, we have to put our Real Reaction logo as well on the on the remote control. So the colours also. So we have ha to ma make it in black, black, yellow. Maybe the sides in yellow and the the the top in black. We make i Maybe you can put yellow on the side and black on the on the front. Yeah, it's cool. Yep. And still trans Still still transparent. Okay. Yeah, we make it som Maybe we have to make it from soft material. Uh I'm not sure. Yeah. Just give five with them, just in a box. Five different Yeah. Cool. Yeah. It it could be like a Nokia, like plastic. That's better prob Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's cool. But maybe you can m make a uh round fluff or soft material. Just only the basic uh basic remote control from normal plastic, and the rounds of it from softer s I dunno. Y Cool. Yeah. Y i if you The numbers could be can be Yeah, that's right. They can choose. Blue. Yeah, but you can't choo You can't choose it when you buy it. You have to choose Is it Okay. Yeah, okay. Maybe put some different ones in it. Doesn't matter. It's just No, just some LED. Okay, cool. Just make it some different colours. Blue, red and green, or something. Yeah, we have to hurry up a bit, so Okay. Yeah, a recharger maybe. We still want to have a recharger, don't we? Is that still the A recha Oh no. Uh Battery. It's just a battery. Yeah. No, just rechargeable batteries. But normally you put a remote control on the table or on the couch. It's dark in the room. No. It's just batteries, that's cheaper. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. But it doesn't really matter, we just make it plastic. The scroll wheels, that's cool. That's for the volume. Yeah. Okay. I don't think that's an opportunity. Just skip it. Because we don't have time for that to to put it in. Yeah, okay. Okay. Oh just sk Maybe you have to skip that one as well. It's No. No. Yeah. But maybe the form has to be a bit different. Not the sh the square form. Just a bit more rounded. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. So We have to decide which one we're going to choose from these. What exactly. Because we have to know it. So the energy uh is the recharger. We already know that. Just a normal battery. Okay. The chip-on-print is a normal one. Okay, the case is just a plastic one. Yeah, re Yeah, regular. Yeah, okay. Yeah, regular. Okay. And we need a plastic case, with a scroll wheel. That's pretty much it. And a flashy light. So uh I'm not sure. But we do I don't know if we expected to draw on this one at this moment. But Yeah. That's for the next one. That's for th Uh that I think that's the next next meeting. But you definitely get a specific instruction. But th think about something that's more rounded. Just And more It has to be Uh a bit. Just just on the top or on the bottom. Maybe the wheel can be uh like uh like this. O um if you draw it like this, you get a What the fuck is it? Okay. Mm Doesn't work. You see what I mean? If I draw here It draws about four centimetres lower than Nah okay. Just. Maybe you can make it like this. And this is all the wheel for volume. So that you just um It's all rounded, so you can do uh turn this one. Yeah, but just not on the top, but uh on the side of it. Maybe, I dunno. Okay, so we have this at the moment. Okay, so we'd have this. Is that okay? And Like this. And uh what's the channel choose? Where do we uh put that? Still on the bottom or That's the numbers. It doesn't make a difference, if you put the s uh the switch channels on side of each other or on top of each other. Because you already have the volume here, so You can also put it here one butt and the other one there. Next to each other. back and forth. So you can also can put it all on the top, and this, you keep this empty. Because you have to hold it as well. But that's not want to zap very quick, so Yeah? Is this a opportunity, or you don't want a different Why? But still the next It's still the next one. Doesn't make Yeah, but fo from left to right is exactly the same. It ma it doesn't make a big difference. But it's exactly th I dunno. I You already have the volume on the side, so you can't make it you can't ma make a mistake. So it's uh So but that's for that's for you, 'cause it's Okay, so hmm. What did What else we have to discuss about? I dunno. Yeah. And the LED. Uh Yeah. Yeah. Uh the logo was has to be on there. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, five. Let's give five. So y you can put the bottom of the remote control in recharger? Is that is that a good good opportunity? So you could put it like that, okay. Uh I'm not sure. But maybe you can just round up the corners a bit. That's all. Yeah. Just round it up. No. Yeah. Yeah. No, just just the corners. Okay. Shapes. It's a bit annoying, isn't it? So we have to make a decision, what kind of form it's gonna have t going to have. And you have the scroll button inside. Okay. But why do we have to round it on the t bottom then? Of Skip that one as well. Okay. Yeah, it's cool. Rubber spongy. Okay, so we have s still one minute left. So just I think it's okay if you just keep it a bit square. No. But I I think it's still for older people. You j still have older people. It's only annoying if it if it's like that f formed like that, like f Whatever. Just you have a normal But i it is it is it is already fancy. Because of the lights on the bottom of it. That's already fancy. Uh maybe maybe make the the mm the wha what's it called uh scroll wheel. Make it in in yellow or something. Just like the colours of Real Reaction. Yeah. It's right. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe the ones we are going to draw there. Maybe we have to ask uh to the the mm to her if it has if it can work better than this. Because it doesn't work properly. So maybe you have to ask her. Okay. Yeah. That's probably Okay, so just finish it. So we make it a bit like m that one probably. Yeah. Is that okay? Okay, only the colour and the flashy light and the We just we just skip the the the voca or was it the the speech recognition. Or keep that? It's okay. But you'd definitely need a advanced chip. So Can we just put it speech recognition in it as well, okay? Yeah. The function of that in there. Yeah. And we need a Probably we need a uh advanced chip then. But it doesn't say anything about it, does it? It doesn't has to say anything. Just You have to just talk to Okay, we have to stop it now. So just Okay, that's a r That's that's a advanced Yeah, we just decide not to put it in, because it's too difficult. Okay, we just put it in, because it's a good feature. We have to stop now. Okay, just We have to stop it now.
