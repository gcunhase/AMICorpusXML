Good afternoon. So Hello. No problem. Okay. That's possible on uh this time of day. Starts at three o'clock. Uh Uh, let me see. Our fourth and last meeting. There he is. Yes. Okay this our last meeting. In this meeting we will discuss our final design. And we will do some evaluation about the, not only the product, but also the project. And then we're going to close the project today as well. So after this you will be uh free to go and uh spend all your money. And this uh design, detailed design meeting uh we will discuss uh the look-and-feel of the design, the usability interface design, and we will do the product evaluation. Um, in order to do that we have this agenda. We'll have the prototype presentation first. Then we will set up some evaluation cri um criteria. Then we will look at the finance. Uh we will have to see if everything we wanna do is also possible within our budget. Because everything costs money, and the more functions you wanna have the more money it will cost. So we have to see if it fits within the twelve and a half Euro per remote. But we will see that later. Then we will do the project uh evaluation, and the closing after that. We've got forty minutes. So we will be finished at half past three. But first um we will do the this is prototype presentation. So, if some yeah if somebody wants step forward. Okay. Okay. Uh but um I thought in a few meetings earlier we uh uh tried to keep it uh simple. Uh just a few buttons and large buttons. But uh I think these are altogether quite a quite a few buttons. So I'm wondering if we if we neely really need all of those buttons. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Long time. Yeah. If you put Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Uh teletext and subtitles are yeah necessary. Okay. Yep. Okay. So we had somebody about th interfa Something about the design of the buttons there? Just n normal plain buttons. Yeah. 'Kay. No. No. Yeah. Okay. Yep. Okay. That's nice. Then because we only have thirty minutes left, I will move on to the finance part, which is pretty exciting, to see if it's all possible what we wanna do. And I can tell you that we're going to have a pretty hard time producing this for twelve and a half Euros. If we see I don't know if I've filled in correctly, so just correct me if you see uh something wrong. I counted two batteries. But maybe we can also use one. I don't know if it's possible. It's rechargeable. That's right. Okay. That's two Euros off. We need the advanced chip. So there's not much to uh to save there. Here we have the single curves. Uh we can see that the difference between uncurved and the single curved is one Euro. Um, I don't know, but I think the single curved is good for design, and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control. I think we have to keep that. Then we have the case material supplements. It's plastic. It's the cheapest one we need. So that's uh not much to save either. But then the biggest costs are the buttons. So maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to uh keep our costs low. Because you have to we will have to get the twelve and a half Euros at the end. Um, so if we Let's fir first count the buttons we have now. Because I Sixteen. Nah, that will be even more then. Eighteen Euros. So, seventeen. Okay, including the help? Yeah. Uh seventeen. I think we can uh discard the help and the mute button uh by pressing down volume long, or pressing down a a number long. That saves us uh one Euro already. 'Cause then we have got fifteen I think? Fifteen buttons. And this is No those are one, I think. Yeah but th it's not stated in this files. So maybe we can we can even make one button with the volume and the channel in one, by pressing That's possibility as well. So And it's good for the design as well. So you can make Uh let's see. If you make this Looks a bit like uh a cross. Plus. Min. Uh s yeah channel. Yeah w Yeah th I think they count uh the materials. Yeah on the chip there. Yeah. That's right. That's right. But I think because we have the advanced chip we can just count this as one button. But No but I think Yeah. Maybe it is, but then it seems to me that it's impossible to get the twelve and a half Euros. Also the L_C_ display, I think it's, I think it's too expensive for the display we use. I think they uh try t That's right, but what's the big advantage of our remote then? Yeah. No. That's extra. That's extra. That's right. That's an option. Poland. Something. Polish supplier. Don't you think we can, if we can count this as v as one button, and integrate th uh these buttons in three, then we save a lot of money as well. Yeah. That's a point. Yep. No. Yeah but uh we have to stick to the twelve and a half Euros. We don't have any more budget to develop it. Yeah. So It is. If you leave out the L_C_ display. And if you use less buttons. Say Or you can take the single chip. There it is. But then w Good looking. Yeah. I think it's uh difficult as well, but Or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers. Then w Because then we save ten buttons. Then we have five and one. And and see. If we have this one and we've got the advanced W uh, we're getting close. Then you will Or maybe you can um scroll. If you scroll you will see the numbers on the L_C_D_ display. Until you've got the right number, then you push it. Alright. It's gotta scroll and push. Okay but then you you can push uh some other button as well. Yeah. That's right. So if you scroll to a number and then you wait a half second, then it g turns to that channel. But it would definitely crop cost, a lot. And we need the battery. And the regular chip is not possible? It has to be advanced? It has to be advanced. Yeah. Okay. And we can save a Euro by a flat design. That's an option we can Then we're almost there. Yeah. So if we Yeah but I think that's That is a big advantage, if we're But Can we use can't we integrate the teletext and the subtitles in one button? If you push it three times? Yeah. Ah that's not really that No. I think if you make a good advertisement uh on television and in the in the guide, you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel. If you just make it real simple. Because it saves it saves a lot of money. And we can keep our L_C_D_ screen, which can provide extra information. How to use the scroll wheel. How to use the other bu buttons as subtitles. And it's good for the innovative design as well. If you would erase these. Mm eraser? And we put uh Looks a bit odd maybe. That is Something like that. Then, yeah. We've got the scroll-wheel. One, two, three, four, five buttons, if we erase this one. And these are two buttons then. Yeah. Yeah. That's really a good good idea, I think. And it will make the use of the scroll wheel uh more obvious indeed. So we make one for the volume, one for the channel. Plus scroll. That's right. So we've got one, two, three. Yeah, we can leave the teletext in if we want. That's m that's better. Y yeah. Mm yeah. Uh yeah, and then you can That's right. So we can decrease this one to four buttons. Yeah. That's no problem. Yeah. Yeah. It's uh it's more the moulds in which they are being made, I think. Single curved is really easy to just fill in. And cases come right out of the machine. And single curved you have to have a different uh different machine, than a flat one. I think this is a really easy one. Um, what does everybody think about a flat or a single curved design? Freek, what do you think? Yeah. Yep. We have to cut costs. Yeah. Yeah I'm ag Ask for more money. Yeah. Yeah. I am agreeing with the usability. Yeah. Yeah. But th um I think we can then keep the single curved one. Just to express our L_C_D_ screen a bit more. So people will use it more, and especially for the help functions, it will be good if we have scroll bar, scroll button. It will be necessary to have good help function, as well. So this is scroll. I think it was better to have this price list a bit earlier. Before we went on to the to the whole design. But I'm glad we could make a bit. It's pretty different, if you saw the last one than this one. Yeah. It will. Yeah. No, but I think I think the most That's right. We can let l We can stick it out, a bit. Like a old old buttons. Maybe that's recognisable for them as well. Yeah. That's a good one. So, I'm afraid we have to move on. And it's uh it's b uh less frightening, I think. If they see this design they think oh, there are only five buttons, and uh But we will see. Yeah. That's definitely right. Yeah. I would buy it. That's right. I would buy it if I was six. No I don't know. What it costs under twelve and a half Euros? No? Uh, yes they are. No. But we can go on with the project evaluation. Let's see. I can sit down I think. We still have fifteen minutes left, so we're nice on schedule. Um, the project process. Evaluation criteria. That's right. That was the the point I forgot. I should There we are. Evaluation criteria. Go ahead. We've got five minutes I think for those criteria. No we've got fifteen minutes but Uh yes. What? Uh yeah. Okay. Yeah, that's because my pen failed to upload his data. I tried to but it's uh it's giving errors by downloading the software. I think it's fancy. Yeah. Six. Very. Subtitles, buttons. Yeah. Seven. Yeah. So we've got twenty cents for our docking station, huh? Yeah. That's right. That's a bit dodgy. I would say four. Four or five between. Between four or five. Yeah. Is it functional? Yes. No. Think it's uh seven. It was. I had them worked out. Mm. They are ugly, not very functional, and getting lost. Yeah. No I think with our new radio button, I think it's uh I think it's better. I think it Yeah. I would give it a four. Then we have to do the three. It's the Yes it is. Yeah. And they wanna put fashion in their products. Uh in the slogan of the company. And we have the removable front cases. So, I think it's very recognisable. Yep. We've got a calculate it. Mm? N We've gonna We're going to evaluate it. Forty nine. Forty one. That's Around eighty percent. What is it? That's eighty four percent. I think that's a pretty nice score. Okay. Thank you. So, that brings us to the project evaluation. Yep. Thank you. Project process. Did we move through the right phases, you think? Along the process? That's right. So lack of information about prices. Okay. Uh Okay. Satisfaction. Was there room for creativity? No? It's because of the finance sheet. Yeah. The room was Yeah. Restrictions. Internet access. 'Kay. Leadership. Was it clear what everybody had to do uh according to their roles and functions? Yeah? Teamwork? Did it work out? Working together? Also, you two of you with the uh last phase? Nice. tasks. Okay. Were the means sufficient for the tasks uh we had to do? Or were they too much? Smart-board. If it wants to download its uh data. Failed download. Smart-board was irritating. So you rather wanted to have a flip-over? Or something else? Faster as well, I think. Yeah. Flip-over. Yeah. Uh you need a smart board uh application I think. But I think you can Yeah. Should be possible. Yeah you can export it as image. Must Yeah must be So the sharing of the information was uh was okay? Uh, network. Yeah, pen is here on the table. Yeah. It's possible. Okay. That's nice. Have we found new ideas for having this kind of meetings? Or Yeah. Yeah. So Yeah. So everybody puts his own score. And then it mediates the score, and you can get one Yeah. That's better. So that's uh How do we call? Evaluation criteria. Okay. Mm, any more ideas? Or questions about the project? Or about the product? Because I think then that we get to our last sheet. Are the costs within the budget? Yeah. Do we Docking station. That's a good point. But maybe because of the docking station the price of the remote can also be a little bit higher? Uh and I think you can compensate that as well. So I think that shouldn't be the biggest problem, because it's very cheap to make as well. Do we think we gonna get the twelve and a half million? Or what was it? Fifteen fifteen million. I think we will. If we gonna export this product. It's innovative. Especially in America. People are pretty decadent. Sometimes. You can do more. Yeah. Just put it on the market for everybody. You can you can change markets where by changing the front covers. That's one thing you can change it with. So you can also try to uh reach the younger people by uh putting fancy covers on on the market. Just as a test. See how it works. That's I think a good advantage. Yeah. Uh, uh then I think we can have our little celebration, right now. That's it. Yeah. I think we still have to fit in one more questionnaire. I think. I don't know. I didn't get a message from the from ending of the Oh I think I have one now. Five more minutes? Oh that's nice. Then we still have some questions. If somebody has some questions they can ask them now. Or we can put these in the project folder as well. Maybe that's Export as picture, I think. Hmm. This is another network, I guess. Does somebody see the project folder? I don't. Hmm. My Documents. Yeah, I'll just put it in My Documents and uh That's okay. Okay. I think I'm going to make our final presentation now. And then I will be back in about ten minutes to show you the final presentation. Summary of the project. Yeah. Questionnaire. I think you all get a questionnaire in in your room. And then I'll meet you in I think about ten minutes, or something. Okay. Thank you. Hopefully my pen will download its software. Oh. Or data.
