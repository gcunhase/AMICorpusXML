Okay. Well this is what me and Richard came up with. The default spot for the on-off button. The mute button just below that. Then there's the volume and channel selectors. Simple plus-minus button. Uh we thought of a help button. If you hold it and you press another button, uh the help goes to the L_C_D_ screen. Then there's the zero to one to zero buttons. A button for teletext. A button for the subtitles. And the company logo. So it's rather simple prototype. And uh we'll have to see from testing uh how the users take it. Sure uh just pop in at any time. I think if you look at most controls, they've got more buttons than this. And well the on-off button, it's it's a necessity. You can't drop that one. The volume and channel buttons, you need you obviously need those those. The mute button could be replaced uh by pressing the volume-down button twice. So we could cancel that one. I think the help button really is necessary because there's no other way to know when someone wants to know what a button does. Well, you can't leave out the number buttons I guess. And Yeah. So it's rather basic already. Yeah, they're It's rather hard to draw on the white-board. But they're supposed to be equal sized, round, with a with a little logo on it for the for the volume, the the triangle and stuff. Just for recognition. So and for the materials we've just chosen for rubber buttons. With a a different colour than the case. So they jump out. And uh that's about it. Yep. Yes. Yep. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Uh that's that's a big cost. If we leave out the display we can also save money on the chip. Which isn't the the docking station isn't even in this c s schematic. So it's not even taken into the price. We we could save money on it. But would it make the remote more usable for elderly people? My mother can't even send send an S_M_S_ message. So Yeah. The margin will get too small. Yeah. Ten. No remote. That's We're getting closer. Yeah. You could just not scroll for a half a second. So you won't need a button. If you want to use an L_C_D_ screen you you need an advanced chip, yes. Yep. Yeah if you v could just leave out one more button. Yeah. I think so. Yeah. What if you have to scroll to page eighty eight? Eight hundred eighty eight. Yeah. Okay. No. We could make two buttons out of that. And just um If you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll-wheel. So that would save two buttons. If you do the same for the channel. More obvious. So if we Yeah. So If we leave out all those buttons, perhaps you can go with the flat flat case. And make it smaller overall. So if you put the the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on-off button, the screen right behi under that, than the scroll button you get a a much smaller remote. And it sh Yeah? Yeah. Richard's argument was very good. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Six. Yeah. Four or five. Yes. No. Mm, we haven't thought of that one. I think that's a three. I still I think it's too m too fancy. Too too flashy. Twendag sieven an twendag. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. That's true. Yeah, there w there was enough room, but the finance uh Yes. Yes, was okay. The tasks are very structured, so you can just do step by step and it's very easy. Well, the smart-board, the d d drawing is just a pain in the ass, but The digital the digital pen is very nice. Yes. Yeah. A flip-over or a more precise uh digit Yes. No. Didn't work. Yes. Yeah. Considering we are not going to make a docking station. Perhaps. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay.
