Okay. Okay. No no no. One. I I think I'm a. In one. It's mine. Mm yeah. Okay. Okay, so. The first I will present the technical function design for user interface for our uh remote T_V_ control. Uh I I will focus on user interface design. Um so move to the next slide. As we know our remote c rem remote T_V_ control it's very has very soph sophisticated functions, as we show from this picture. There's a lot of functions. Over, I think over s twelve or twenty s functions of a remote T_V_ control. So how can we um design a user interface with so sa with so many sophisticated functions? Um, let's move to next slide. Um. Yeah. So I so we want to design uh elegant, easy to use inter interface. A very good example is Google. As we know uh Google it's a very successful because his um powerful function, but with very easy to use user interface. Um so move to next s slide. So my job is to uh design a Google T_V_ controller which I want to have sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface. So That's the end of the talk the end of the presentation. Uh With sophisticated functions, but with very yeah powerful. Yes. Yep. Yeah. But if we have very very good user interface it take less time for user to learn how to use it. Yeah, that's my job. That's my job. It's not the easiest I've got to. Yep. Powerful and easy to use. Yeah, that's the point. So what, the wireless remote control? There's a wire with remote control? Okay. Okay. Okay. Wireless remote control. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Design a wireless remote control. Yeah. Functions. Yeah. Yeah, I think possible. Because we can We can uh mix uh several function in one button. So lets you then you have less buttons. But I'm not sure No you you can have a switch menu, so you can well for example Yeah, I think so. Like for for example you can uh you can category the function i i into several classes. Then for um you can have a switch menu, so you put the switch menu to it it tend to this kind of this category of functions. Then you you put the switch button, then it switch to another category of functions. Yeah. For example, if you have remote control you you can rem you can control your T_V_ and also you can control your uh recorder. So there's a different functions, but i if you you there's a button you can switch between control T_V_ and control your recorder. So we can has less buttons. But what I'm not so sure is about how to make the remote control look funny look fancy, not funny. Because different people have a different opinion about fancy. You know. Because maybe a colourful is fancy for some people, but maybe simple and uh uniform colourful is fancy for some for other peoples, so. Yeah, personalised colour. Because you know Yeah, because maybe some people prefer a red remote control, some people prefer black remote control. Maybe we can have di di we can have uh several options, so user can select which colour they prefer, so. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Control. Mm-hmm. Mm. Okay. But there's balance between function and the cost. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hm. Okay. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And cheap. A low cost. Yeah, there's that box in uh o of it. A pi There's that box in the T_V_, so with the set box you you can connect internet with your T_V_. Ok It's It's not so uh popular now. Mm. Global, okay. So I I so As as for the colour, what what do you think? Yellow? T_V_ remote control? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, okay. Okay. Mm. Okay. Okay. Okay.
