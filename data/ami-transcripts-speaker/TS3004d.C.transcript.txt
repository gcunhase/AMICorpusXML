Okay. Okay. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah, and Or are we making a slide open, like underneath? Or fold open? I don't know. It's probably better. Yeah, s Like underneath uh you can slide it open and you other functions. Yeah. Think that's better. The Yeah, I I think so. I don't know. Ah okay. Yeah. Yeah, it's Let's do it together. Okay. Yeah, we just made a Word file with the basic elements. Uh the look-and-feel model. Uh well the form, the case um as drawn there. Simply a square with uh round corners. So that's basically it. Uh the material should be hard plastic. Uh colour changeable, and also transparent. And colour and transparent, or just transparent, I don't know. Um then the elements. Uh we have The functions are just basic. Like uh I've pointed them here. Mute function, on-off function, text functions. This uh switch channel. And this is the the num-pad. And the logo is over here, and the mic. And the scrollwheel, no? You operate that with your pointing finger. So you hold it like this in your right hand and Uh I dunno. Yeah, maybe maybe uh you have to configure it. Yeah, or or on the slide function, I don't know. Well we haven't had time to design that, the slide pad. Yeah. Um the position? Yeah, you write uh You wrote this, so. Yeah. But it's not uh impossible to use it, if you're left handed. So y Because you can use your thumb then. Mm yeah. Yeah, okay. just so you get that. Yeah. Yeah, these are just basic functions, so All the non-basic are in Okay. Um Okay, maybe we use this button for the Yeah. A second level? Like a a new blank one or Or just here? Okay. Yeah. So what do we need? Yeah, just God damn it. So this is the Extern or something. So here are multiple speech buttons, I don't know how many. I don't know the functions. Okay. What else? What else? Uh menu. Uh With arrows. Like a normal um Yeah, with in the middle um a menu button. Okay. Yeah, okay. We can put those here. So did we miss anything? Okay. Oh wh Here? Okay. Yeah, or th or the Yeah. Yep. Yeah, but then you can switch back to normal telete teletext. You just switch it off and then Well w we thought of a text button. And if you press it again, you get the the the through view. Yeah, b but but if you're in the second stage, the third stage is switch teletext off. So you can switch back from second to w first. Okay, okay. Yeah mm nee uh No, if i uh the remote can send like the the code for seven hundred, page seven hundred to the television. Th th th if you switch it on. Th i Yeah, I dunno. Okay. Yeah, those memory functions. Yeah. Was uh this logo for uh volume? Okay. So that's it? Mm. No no Yeah. Just hard plastic. So Uh I think just um Yeah, but I think uh you have that problem more often with rubber buttons. In the bottom. No, evaluation is Yeah beautiful's is also a matter of taste. And what colours should the buttons be? But can you change those too, with uh the switch? Okay. Yeah. It's ju so subjective. One more thing. Are w are we changing uh Or are they there uh backlights on the slide panel too? Or n no back light? Yeah? And and the switch channel is uh There is a back light too? Yeah. Hmm. Yeah, just backlight. Not not the buttons. And th and the the normal backlights also not the buttons, but behind the buttons. So the buttons are just grey. Okay. No, but you don't have to use that. And you on don't have to pay attention to that second layer. That's th that's the main thing that's so good about it. Well, I think it is. So so few information that you can easily decide what buttons w for what function. Mm uh. The normal. And the one you showed is just all buttons and you don't know Yeah. The speech function and the colour. Colour. Mm it's pretty new, I think. Speech is new. Yeah. Yeah, we didn't draw that too, but Yeah, that's just a normal th s simple thing. Well it's a already in the folder. L like number seven. I think it is. No, I think it is. Okay. Mm two, I think. Yeah. We've got a one for fancy look-and-feel, and that's what attracts the young audience. So think that's a two or a one. Yeah, but s it That's basically not not handy. And I don't thi I don't see Yeah. Yeah. No. Yeah, you could make a a front a front that's that's like uh like a banana, or something. Like a a f banana kind of front. No. Yeah. Eleven divided by six. We're not too hard on ourselves. Okay. Okay. Yeah, but uh we have to make a speaker then too. If you want to make it beep. But we can we can do it uh underneath the logo. If you do uh Yeah, okay. Mm okay. But uh is uh uh Okay. But but is it inc Does it include a a homestation or Can we make that for uh h twenty cents? Yeah. Yeah, it's four. It's kind of weird that we we get this information now, afterwards. Because Sure. Beautiful. Yeah m If we got a high mark for um uh innovativeness or innovativity then there we probably have been creative. Yeah. Huh. No, I think Yeah. Just normal discussion, I think. Not one leader or something. Yeah. And make notes. Yeah. Yeah, w we had so much information, that we get through email and just Yeah. Yeah, th that's weird. Hmm hmm yeah. So we're bacal basically just lucky to uh get the price right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, i if if it would be faster, it would be great. Yeah. Yeah, and p just point with a mouse. Yeah. Just old fashioned kinda blackboard style. But you might as well do it in normal computer style. Yeah. Yeah. And it's far too slow this way. No. What's that? Hmm. Yeah, but still, you couldn't make a fancy a f you couldn't make a a prototype out of this. Because we don't have any sizes and Yeah, but it You can't possibly do that in such a short time, I think. Yeah, just brainstorming basically. So are we finished? Okay. Yeah. Oh okay. It's now quarter past three. So Yeah. Now we can look at this. We're probably not supposed to look at this, but Yeah, from the previous group. The touchscreen, yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Here are the basic functions in here, the selecting dev devices. Hmm. No. Yeah, this one. Hmm. This is a very interesting design. Well it has a L_C_D_, I think. And what else do we have? Yeah, everything. It wants to know what we do in our spare time. Warning. Finish meeting now. Warning. Warning. Okay. Boom-boa-ring-bing. Fill in the questionnaire. What now? Okay. No more chit-chat. Yeah. Okay.
