Mm. Ah. Hey. Ah. Now I have my screen back too. Yeah. Yeah. Very interesting. Large. A lot a lot of buttons buttons. Yeah. Yes. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Yep. Yeah. But, thi i uh This is with an L_C_D_? No, not. Uh, can you give an indication in b uh in the cost difference between uh the chip with L_C_D_ or without? 'Cause it I think if we have an L_C_D_, it will also sell a lot better. And that might uh bring back the costs uh Huh. 'Kay. My turn? Mm. So So Yeah. So, my uh presentation is about trend-watching. Uh, I did some trend-watching. It's very important to uh keep up with latest trends. 'Cause if you don't, you won't sell. So, well how we did do that? Uh, well we made an investigation of the market, by Trendwatchers. They uh watch in uh cities like uh Paris and Milan. Of course, well known for their uh trend uh trends. And well, uh what did you find? Uh, we have two groups, young and trendy, and the old and rich. Well th and the young and trendy, they uh they starting to like uh fruit and vegetables uh as a theme for n uh clothes, shoes, and also uh products. And um, material? That should feel have uh a spongy feeling. And to get a feeling for what it is, uh here is an image of it. Then the old and rich. They like uh dark colours, and simple, recognisable shapes. And um, they also like uh familiar material, uh especially wood. Now, another picture. To get a feeling for this. Well, uh then already come to my personal preferences. We uh aim at the younger market. So, we should also be uh look at their uh trends. However, with trends it's always if there's it's now. It it it might last one year, and next year it be uh can be totally different. And I think we want to sell our product for longer than one year. So, we m must not just only look at what the trend is now, as it might be totally different next year. So, that's uh one thing to keep in mind. Yeah. Any questions? Yeah. Mm. Can make several uh concepts. We have this, and we had the idea of an um a more uh uh uh like sh in the shape of your hand. Yeah I I I uh yes. Yeah. A g Mm.. Yeah.

The uh um The mute button. We have two buttons missing. The mute button. And um, the to to uh have to uh numbers Okay. But, uh Okay. And on the L_C_D_, how much it costs? Uh, it costs extra? Yeah. Yes. Uh Uh, yeah, but Yeah. If you If we have uh then something standing here, with the L_C_D_. Um, Yeah. I can't see the. But, uh the easy of uh, th the ease of use wasn't uh the most important uh aspect of it. Uh, for us it's about to sell it. Uh One. No. You have more. You have still ten. Yeah. What? Okay. Okay.
