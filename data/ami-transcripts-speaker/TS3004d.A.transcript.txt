Oh. Okay. So just f um So this is our agenda. You're F You're going to show your pr prototype presentation after me. Uh I didn't Oh yeah. So these are the So these are the um last notes we I made. If anything doesn't look right, just say it to me then. I don't have to put it in the report. Okay, but it's still possible uh uh financially. So if you want to, it's okay. Okay, just Slide open is uh quite usable for remote controls. Maybe that's better. Yeah, that's that's a very good point. Yeah. Okay. So this is okay? Okay, so that's Uh I'll just have a look how much that is. But um Okay, for the Okay. No, you have a different chip for speech recognition. So So I already calculated that and it's still in the budget. So it's okay. So you can show your prototype if you want to. Okay, cool. Okay. Mm. So how many functions do you need for for uh the microphone? Yeah, speech recognition. Just Only one button to say it's on or off. So you can put it on the back as well if you want to. Okay. Yeah, you can put it separate. Okay. And do you still can, do you still can choose what colour, kind of colour you want? How do you want to implement that? Just on the Maybe on the second level as well? Okay, just draw draw the second level, because we need that as well. Yeah, as well. Just make make a Just just draw a second level one and say all options that are still left or something. Yeah. No no, just on Down there. So uh Just uh if you s Yeah, y Maybe, yeah. For the bottom. No, you gotta slide it. Yeah, it's right. Yeah. You want to save that file as well? The drawing? Doesn't really matter. Just just uh Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Or we just make it three buttons, all the colours on it. Just red, yel uh red, green and That's that's very easy, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. No, ma on on o on the on the Yeah. Just make it Yeah, just put it on those extra f extra function as well. Oh just three stages, you Yeah, that's okay. Yes, that's to remember. Yeah, but that's that's uh That's a functionality for the television. Okay. Yeah, but you have to search every time again. That's what what happening if you do it like that. But it's still the television that has to do that. No, that's what the television does. Okay, it's cool. Yeah, that's fine. Is this prich pretty much it, yeah? It's too expensive to make it from a different material anyway. Yeah? Okay, cool. Mm mm mm mm mm. Yeah, I don't know what this means. But I think we just evela evaluated this one. Oh okay, you made some criteria. Okay, cool. Okay. You have some usability criteria or Okay. Look-and-feel? Okay. Okay. Uh I think uh if you have a kind of iPod idea. It quite beautiful. It's We are actu We are the Flashy. But uh It's black. Yeah, yellow light. Do we have yellow light? No, not really, but it's possible. It's Yeah, different colours. This is Oh, the same as th th the cover. But also th the light behind it. No, no. Make them No, just make them black or grey or something. Yeah. Yeah, just give it a one. It's okay. It's perfect. I think it's just what you want. Or not? Okay, just give it a two. Yeah. No. No, it's only on the number, behind the numbers and uh That as well, yeah. Yeah, but that's unnecessary. Yeah. It doesn't make No. Yeah. But Yeah. Mayb Okay. Yeah, just only Yeah, that's right. So Yeah, that's how I think. Ye Yeah, this It is a one. It's okay. It's cool. This is a difficult one, because we we don't Yeah, we don't know it about the Uh it's it's very easy to use, but uh the second layer is not easy to use. It's That's No. But the rest of it is very easy, because there are so so n So it is learnable um f i i In the first place it's very easy to use. And I think its scrollwheel is u easy to use as well, if you have ever used uh a different kind of uh of uh device. But yeah. Okay, just Easy to use is very cool, so just give it a two. No, but definitely better, much better than uh than uh than avera average, yeah. Okay. Slide is not n is is not new. No. I already have a Uh I already have a V_C_R_ and it's about from nineteen eighty eight. And they all have a slide in it. So that's not new. Yeah. That's cool. Yeah for a Uh for a f There are no games on it, that's that's It's not a one, it's a two again. But If you have Yeah. Oh yeah, that's right. Rechargeable. Yeah, just draw it afterwards. If you Can you save it on the same, in the same map as the other ones? In the the project uh map? Yeah. Mm-hmm. Uh save as? No, that's not in the project. Oh yeah, okay. Smart board. Yeah, but this one. This one is not yet in the Oh oh. But you still have to draw the resi the recharger. Okay. And new features, so we give it a two or also again a one? No, I think i if you have games on it, then then you give you have a one. But not No, just so it's still a two. Targeted audience. Uh we are the targeted audience? Do we like it? Yeah, but l younger than forty. So we we are exactly the targeted group. I think so, yeah. You get the fancy things for younger people. And you get the the aesthetic things for older people. So you want Yeah, you get different colours. So Oh. So that's eleven. It's Yeah, it is one point eight three. Oh yeah, that's still Yeah, maybe we have to skip that one. Okay. So I just got a financial um You s saved it or No. Okay, let's have a look at this one here, the production cost of it. If I forgot anything, just say it to me. It just is a battery. Yeah, there are some that they didn't mention, because recharge is not on the list. But okay. So I think we are pretty much in the right direction, because it's twelve point three Euros. So this is a regular chip incl and and a sample speaker. So that's both. Yeah, and single curved curved. No, that's not on the list. But that shouldn't be. Probably. I just The b the button supplements, I didn't I d I was wondering if this special colour maybe was I'm not sure. See it's I think it's okay like this. It's hard to say. But maybe we have to um Yeah, okay. Special colour, you can skip this one, because it's all quite normal. We get different ones, that's all. So you can put a recharger in it as well. But this is expensive, the sample speaker. Yeah. Yeah, that's included. Yeah, no. Okay, so this is uh pretty much it this. So I just want you Yeah, we just made it. So we can do the project evalu evaluation now for uh for everything together. Okay. We can do some discussion about this. Was there room for creativity? Paul, was there room for crea creativity? Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so the leadership Was there a leadership and Okay. What do you have to say about that? I dunno. Yeah, I know. Okay, next one. Uh team work um The the third meeting I think that one was pretty hard. We were not all We were not um agree with every not agree with. We're not finished. Yeah. Yeah, finance. But the teamwork was okay. Yeah. 'Kay. Yeah, what I have to say about uh means. The smart board is okay. Digital pen is horrible. I dunno if you use it. But if you want to download it to your computer, it's doesn't work. No. Yeah. It's the same for the presenta for the presentations. You can do it from here. That's much easier than standing there. And so you've Yeah. Yeah, like. Okay. I think Yeah, okay. So we made it in time. And we made a remote control. In the budget, yeah. I don't know what it mean. Just For remote control probably. No, for the project. Yeah. But it's for the next team. We don't have to do that. Yes, I think just I just write a final report. No, we have only four minutes left. Uh it's okay. Okay. You have to save everything, you know that, huh? Okay, yeah.
