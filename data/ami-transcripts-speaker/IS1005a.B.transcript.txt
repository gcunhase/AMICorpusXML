Now what. Okay, so my name is Petre. You can call me Petre, or Peter if you like. I don't care. Uh, in the project I'm supposed to be the technic. Bob, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So probably I would try to try to draw the animal. Well sh should I draw the picture of the animal? I I th I think I should. Okay, so. Um. Okay, American, um. Um. I would use the bird. So I tried to sketch it out. I had to first uh write it down because I am not absolutely sure if I can draw it, but ah. Can you recognise it as a bird? Okay it's your turn to Oh it's okay. Yeah. I should get used to the tool, so. Oh just wait a little bit. C could we put it here, to make it as straight as possible? Ah probably not. Okay, it it works like this. Are you left-handed? Oh, pity. Ah, it's maybe better if you leave it. You won't draw them, or? Just try. I would like to see how it looks like. No, I think it's clear. It's okay. It's in it's indeed beautiful. Okay. Bob. Have to remember it. Bob. Per unit, I guess. Y oh okay. Okay. Oh. Okay, I have also some points uh. Maybe two points. Uh first would be that in current remote controls there is no back light, so if you are if you are uh playing with this in the dark room it's it's probably worth to to have something like uh back light. And maybe it could be also dependant on the the amount of of light in the room, so that if if it's in the day it doesn't need to be back lighted because it works on the battery, so. So something like this. And the second thing, f second point from me would be that in a normal remote control there is uh there are two buttons for volume control. But I prefer like a potential-meter or something like. You know, some slider or Not just two discrete buttons for volume, but something which Yeah, but I can reach In uh one second I can mute it down, or or make a high volume. Ah, n. If it drops to the floor then it starts to scream. Yeah, f It depends what what you feel about that. Yeah but we can we can think of these things afterwards, but if you have some more notes on that. Okay. Um. Okay, just a second. Which i which is Hamed,? Okay. Uh I am the Technical Designer, I dunno which one, uh v. User Interf Okay. Okay, so I'm the first one. I see. Sign. Okay. Uh.
