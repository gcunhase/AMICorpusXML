Okay. Mm. Very fun. Oh right. Okay. Mm. Okay. Sure. We made three for you. Um one's based on the banana, one's based on the tomato and the other one is st Look. Oh yeah, well yeah, we had v some red left over. So. Okay, so this is the um non to non uh no buttons one, or as mm few buttons as possible, mainly speak recognition. The yellow there is the um the slogan, yeah, that we need to incorporate, it's very simple. If you do need buttons, you can flip it over, and there's some there, um but mainly it's speech recognition. Yeah. Yeah and yeah they might project things onto the screen which you can do on there. Mm I'm not sure about that. Um and this one is the one w more like the one w that we looked at earlier. Yeah, you guys can have a look at that if you want. Yeah, sure. Um that one is Oh no, it's delicate. That's that's already got its stand that one. That's it stand. It does also lie flat, but that's the that yellow stand there represents the the charging stand. Um the black on the back is the slogan. Uh yeah, that Well, we did think of that. Yeah, if it's standing up it's it's on there, but also we're gonna have the company name on the front, which is the little black kind of line in the middle. So um and that's the um transmit the L_E_D_ thing. These are the s two scroll ones which we thought could be channel up and down and volume up and down. We n were weren't sure about putting them there, because um i it's it kind of could get bashed. Yeah. Well, if you hold it, you can you all can hold it, is it does actually feel quite ergonomic, if you've got small hands. Um, obviously I don't think that's real sized. It would have to be a bit bigger. Okay. Um that's a speaker at the top, so you can speak into it like a little walkie-talkie as well for speak recognition. Um and um then the buttons. Yeah kind of self-explanatory, just buttons whenever you need them. Tried to keep it simple. Oh that's the charging base prongs at the bottom. We used those. And um then the big red button in the middle is the on and off one. It's not in the traditional place, but um it's quite an obvious place. So there we go and and um we have the banana-based one too. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So are there any um improvements or issues or Oh. Oh. Ooh. Mm-hmm. More like a traditional remote control. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Like an S_ shape. Okay. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Cool. Cool. So we could even add something. Well maybe we could add something, but maybe if What do you th We're trying to save money, so. Yeah, if we're happy with the design there's no point in spending money, if we don't have to. But if there is anything you think we've missed out there, then, you know, feel free to add it. Maybe I mean obviously it would be bigger so there might be more space for the the slogan on the front, because it's not in an ideal place right now. Mm. I think it went quite smoothly. W I think we were very creative. Oh right, okay. Mm-hmm. Excellent leadership. Yeah, everyone got enough input, I think. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. Well um. Mm. Yeah, maybe. Oh, you got a presentation, sorry. Yeah. Mm, love to eat that now. Kind of a green banana now. It's this as well, sorry, we forgot to mention it'll be made out of kind of a rubbery latex, new material that we've got. I've got. Yeah. Oh could you pass the tomato please. Sorry. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Sorry. Sorry, carry on. Mm-hmm. Okay. Um. Mm-hmm. Um I think Yeah, it did. It had all the basic buttons that they needed as well as the uh new technology that people said they wanted. Um so. Does it work? Yeah. So. I would say seven. Seven is good, yeah, isn't it? I can't True or false? No sorry tr one is true. Yeah. Okay, so one. Yep. Mm yellow. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay. Is that no is that not trends? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. But in electronics, I think, it's not q always quite so um you don't always have so many choices as with chocolates. I think, you know, if you're going to buy a T_V_ maybe a company'll have That you're going to choose from, a company'll have two or three choices, but they're different designs. We were coming up with one product. No, I mean uh obviously your opinion, I'm just trying to Okay. What are we doing? Adding them up? Oh. Okay. Okay, yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Well um going on uh the specifications that we had, that fruit and vegetables are quite popular, and that people like something that is good to look at and not many buttons, I would give it um, well, because it's hard to make a fruit good to look at, that that looks cool, you know, so I would actually give it a three. Tha three or four, I'm not sure. Three. Go for three. That's fine. Mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Um. Yeah, the company strategy, okay. Um there was lot of discussing, that was good. Um I feel I got my say. Um so I'd give the company strategy a two. Okay. Is it? Okay. Okay, so one or two. One. Okay, just leave it, it's fine. Mm. Yeah, one. Okay. Woo-hoo. Cool. Yeah.
