Um sure. You or me? Okay. Well, since our materials aren't exactly what we were going for, I'm just gonna translate what this all means for you. The base is gonna be gunmetal gray, which is what we had decided, and it's gonna be plastic. Um then there's the latex cover, which is what you see as red. Um because it can be replaceable, we just kinda went with the colour. Um and then the buttons are actually kind of poking through rather than on top. Um and the buttons will be a l much lighter blue, almost see-through. It's just sort of a very pale blue and a light-up yellow. The whole thing lights up if you press any button, rather than it just that one button will light up. Um and then at the bottom we have our logo. Um bright yellow sort of design with the R_R_ which will actually look like our logo. And then on the side you have the buttons. They're one button, but they kind of push up and down. I don't think they're scrolling. Right, yeah. And then yeah, the buttons. Thumb-shaped. Yeah. And then the last thing is just that it'll be black labelling on top, just which we didn't do. Single. Right. Oh thank you. Feel good meaning what? Physically, okay. Yeah. True or false, easy to use. Yeah. Yeah, two. Mm I don't think it's that fashionable. I'd give it like three or four. But then I'm not fashionable, so don't use my opinion. Does it feel good? Yeah, it's gonna be thicker. Depth. I'll give it a one. Oh right, the Right. Yeah I go four. Squishy and fruity. It's just trendy, basically. Okay. It's plastic. And special colour. No, we don't have the scroll. Buttons. Oh like the twenty nine means like you have both scrolls and push-buttons. But we don't have any scrolls. Two interfaces, is that what w should we s say? Okay, fine. Yeah. And then s yeah. We're over? Okay. Oh, I see. We didn't have a whiteboard. Yeah. And no internet. I think we did well. Yep. Gouges. Irritating. And no internet. Misses. I do. There's so much available. Like it's information Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's why I don't like uh Macs or Apples, just 'cause I look at it, and I know it's probably a very good computer, but I look at it, and I'm taken back to elementary school, 'cause they look the same. They look like they did when I was in elementary school, and that's so old-fashioned to me. Exactly, so I associate them with like really low-tech, really cheap, bad Yeah. But the my but my one issue is just like the whole it's for T_V_ only. I was like who's gonna buy a remote just for the T_V_ unless they've lost theirs. You're kidding. No, no. No, marketing has to actually create the desire for it. Ri They'll be sexy with it. Oh right. Let you loose. Yeah, no. Good.
