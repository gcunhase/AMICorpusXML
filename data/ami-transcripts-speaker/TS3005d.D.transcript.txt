That's new one? Yep. Yep. Big microphone. Oh okay. That's the place where it's going to be, not the size. Mm-hmm. Yeah, okay. Of course. Mm. Mm, th yeah. Small. Shit. 'Kay. Evaluation. 'Kay, my task was this time to put up a questionnaire by which we can evaluate the design of the remote control by the questions we requirements from the of the users. My name, my job, okay. The methods. Questionnaire with seven point scale from one to seven, from true to false, like question, is remote big enough, we can say it's true or it's false by steps. One means absolutely not true, seven means true. The three important things of refa are uh from th of this year is are, is the remote control fancy enough, is it in innovative enough, and is it easy enough to use. And then evaluation itself. Uh. So. Okay. First question. Is the design fancy enough? Project Manager, what do you think? But does it Yeah. Think. Yeah, yeah, you can. Isn't going to be a little bit heavy at the top? With two batteries, the whole print plate and t and top, and if you're holding it quite a lot I think Yeah. Yeah, we have to rate. Is it fancy enough? True is one, false is seven. So fancy enough means, does it comes to the younger people and the elder people. I think Yeah, I have to agree, all the colour colours don don doesn't matter that m that much now, it's only design. And the design. So A two? Yeah, I n used I wouldn I should use that one, but it doesn't Okay, no it's two? True is a one. Very true, is it very true or isn't that true? Yeah, I think two. That's fancy enough. Then? Okay. Let's give it a two. Is it innovative? Enough. We have for the search function. The scroller a bit I think it's it's a one yeah. True. Also huh uh-huh the buttons, are they easy to find? That was a big requirement of the old people. Are all the buttons easy to find? Not only this buttons, all the buttons. I think th it's easy t Yeah, I think this is easy now. I think th I think the options buttons are not the the easiest way to to to handle. True. I would rate it a Yeah, okay, that's true, that's true. But that's that's vantage of L_C_D_ screen, you can have text. Yeah. I think it's a three. I personally think, because I d I don't think i maybe it's easy to use, it has to be easy to find right away. I I think if you have the button at the right, I don't think you can find the option button that easy. You can touch it. Yeah, okay, but you have y then you have here s written option on here, the teletext button, right? Okay, then okay, good. Then I think also two, yeah. Yep. It's easy to use, as well for younger as elderl elderly people. Young means sixteen to forty years. And elderly from forty eight to their death. Also if you're sixty years old Also Yeah, as well as your if you're fif sixty years old, you're holding one of those things in your hand No, but we're going to th make this f for a all kind of people, so it it it has to be If you read the manual, always. So Also two? Not a seven for this? I would also say three. Remotes overwhelmed with buttons. No, that that's that's yeah. Tha that's a one, I think, that's definitely a one. No? Oh yeah. Yeah, I think isn't, this has to be something like isn't overwhelmed. True. Remote control has uh colours that different that meet different target groups. Yeah. That's true. Also with rubber? Yeah, okay. Yeah? That's a one? Okay. Uh I have The material used is spongy, that that's uh that's a one, that's m rubber. Yeah, I th think it's not the most spongy thing. Yeah. Remote control is hard to lose. Y you can't you can't lose it if you're sixty years old. If first time see the thing you didn didn't adjust uh set the microphone, and then you lose it, then you have lost it. It isn't hard, no. I think I think this is a two, personally. No. Isn't hard to lose. Yeah. You can't lose it. Or if you're you're sixty years old, your demands I think yeah, I think also. Huh? Yeah? Oh, okay. No. Okay okay okay. Remote control mainly be sold to younger people. Yeah? True? Very true? No, I don't think very true because the colours. We have the colours. Um we have the buttons is aren't that that much. Nah, the material isn't that So I don I think I think it's a three. Yeah, but I uh Okay, okay. I think because yeah? In the features? Because younger peoples are cr critical and they wanted a lot of features on this thing. L_C_D_ screen and scroll. I I think they'll be quite met with their expectations. No. It's three features, basically, the L_C_D_ touch screen is feature. The microphone is a feature. Yeah, okay. I think yeah, and then you have the audio settings, channel setting, video settings. Yeah yeah. So I've chos I shou I think it's it's it's a one. Personally, yeah. I think once you've 'cause you have the channel features b uh you have the uh screen features, audio features, the you have all buttons on it which you'd like, microphone extra, L_C_D_ screen extra, scroll thing extra. Make it make it a two. Or make it uh a fucking two. You can see the remote control is R_ and R_. Has oh yeah, do did have nah y you have the black one. And we'll probably make also a yellow one. Maybe two. X_ marks spot. And the menu is avail that is available is easy to use. Yeah, tha that's so true. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, uh I think that wou that would be quite hard to learn to use it. No, I'm not not convinc. Let's go th for I think it would be a t yeah, two. Now lower. So okay, we have one three, a one, that that have to got up. Two two two two two. So two, yeah. The average is a two. That is quite good in my opinion. That Ooh. Ooh. Top. Okay. Yes. No, it's two. The average is two. Yeah, I uh uh I uh saved it. f fifty five Euros. No. Yeah mm yeah, maybe. The microphone. Yeah? maybe you're going scrap scrap it. No prob. Ah. Count it? Li like write it be Ah, okay, cool. Huh? Yeah? Oh, yea yeah, you design it. Um Yeah. Solar cell. No it took a battery? Yeah. We have No, we have sample speaker. But b al but we also have sample speaker, do Oh, we already on nine. We have double curved. Single. This one is This one is curved like this, right. It's curved like this. Yeah, bu what Oh, but we have curves like it and it. There are two curves, right? Oh, okay I understand, I understand. Rubber. Push button. No, we don't have push button. L_C_D_ display. Eighteen and a half, damn. We have to lower it with six points. Twelve and half. We could use I think we should scrap the sample speaker. It's four pri it four units. But w d wha Curved then it will be square. Was that does that mean to it, single curve? Okay. Yeah, but tha that that only is one. No, one. So we don't Yeah, we also have to No, otherwise we don't have an L_C_D_ screen. Single curved. Flat. Yeah, so that does doesn't doesn't that mu I think Scrap sample speaker? That that's uh Yes, four points. Yeah, but what what else what else uh do you want to scrap? F You have to we have to scrap four points. Ma make it with wood instead of rubber? Yeah, it it i Yeah, it also uh it also takes one point less. Yeah. I think it is. Yeah. Yeah. Sample speaker. Yeah, okay, three. Point three. Huh? Point twelve. That's a scroll wheel. Yeah, but a wood we can make it brown, dark brown, not wood. Is it also no that that's just normal colour fruit colours. Normal colours, yellow Yeah, but then I d I don't think we can ever make to a twelve and half. But then we have to scrap L_C_D_ display, we have to scrap uh s advanced chip. No then we have to scrap everything we got because how many colours we gonna make? Five? Then we have two. S touch. Then we can make add two colours on it. Yeah, two colours it. They can add two colours. But the colours. Um how ma uh the colours like l she told, is that all the colours we add or Yeah, but we we we are we have yellow, red, uh black, titanium. Ah okay. Yeah, but the rubbers alls original black. Yeah b Yeah, but we're gonna make it yellow uh red, and then you add you have two special colours on top of the one we have now. Yeah, but m Yeah, because we have more colours than only black. I then I think I p I don I don't think they me mean they're special Yeah, okay okay, true. True, true. We have two points spare. Nee one point. Mm yep. Y yea the scroll wheel is dropped. Yep. Tap. It should've work. Yep. just tap somewhere. No? Evaluation drops. And erase the mic. Looks like a iPod. Oh. All I need is mic. Station page. I think we it should be b it would be better if we worked a little bit together. Now we worked through each other, something he said yeah, and you had information I also had, so some some things I had in my presentation, they already told, so So yeah, that I don't think that is the best way to work at for such project. Yeah, no, or maybe session of five minutes together or something, and then work separate. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah m yeah, like she told. Then you can work together too by mail or by, I dunno, chat, something, but now we're completely separated from each other. I don't think that was the best way, but Yeah, the technology's okay. Yeah okay, but I don I do I think becau that's because Yeah. Yeah, like the f like a plotters or something, yeah. Yep yep yep yep yep. Yeah, it is useful, but No. Yep. I didn't use it at all. I didn't use. No yeah. It is it is yeah, it is easy for to design something and then load it in your computer. Yeah. Yeah. It's b bi little bit too big to write. Yeah. Fat document, those. Team work was okay. Only thing that we worked through, past each other. With some things that was only problem, but Yeah yeah yeah, but furthermore better. That's yeah, no prob. Ah. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Little bit uh lo yeah. Too late it it it took a lot of time before you got your ema yeah. I played I think seven times Solitaire something. Wha Oh right, it is there. No, I I never got that. I always N yeah. So does this I think lik oh and information was a bit low I think, sometimes, in in in in the beginning I didn't understand what what to do. Yeah, like I with with the remote and I never new we have t we had to uh yeah made a made a rec a remote control. Yeah, so So, yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Faster. Yeah. Yeah, it only costs four units. Uh yeah. Um Yeah. Nothing. I think we got it already. Yeah. And furthermore the the the network was okay. Everything you loaded was also av available there. So Yeah. Yeah, but that It's now half past four half past three, so Yeah, okay. Yeah, okay. Mm-hm. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. No prob. Mm-hmm. I think you do. Can you find it as a J_ PEG? No. In uh Celebra Or shouldn't I? Six hundred. No, I yeah. I think eight hundred six hundred is better. Yeah. Nah, name. Hey. Oh my God. Ten. Yeah. Ten. Uh. Celebration time, come on. Peace out nigger. Entree
