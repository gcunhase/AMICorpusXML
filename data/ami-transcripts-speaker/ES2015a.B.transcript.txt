Okay okay Okay. Hello. Okay. My name's Poppy. I'm the Industrial Designer for this project. Um, I'm going to be responsible for the functional design phase. Also the conceptual design and the detailed design for the final product. Okay. Okay. So this is a television remote control? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Got those notes. Okay. Okay. Oh, to go first. Oh, are we all doing it individually? Okay, let's stand up and support you Okay. Do you have elk where you come from? You do. Okay. Sheep. Yeah, cows. That's a great elk. Yeah. Brilliant. Mm. Very nice. Okay. Okay, I'll go next. I am a big animal lover. I like all sorts of animals, but for the moment I'm gonna draw a cat, in memory of my poor cat that died recently. It's gonna be a bit of a strange drawing, but never mind. Not as artistic as Heather's drawing. Bit more cartoon style. But I like cats because they're so independent, and they always seem to be doing what they want to be doing. Um, but that doesn't mean they're completely not sociable, 'cause they enjoy interacting with humans as well, and they seem to enjoy the good things like sunshine and, um, running around outside as well as being inside, and enjoying their food, and generally just, they just seemed so cool and they just know what they're doing. Uh I reckon they're sort of, they got it sorted. They know what they want. Basically, that's why I like cats. I'll rub that out. There you go. Ooh. Well there are loads of different types of dogs, so I'm sure it'll represent one kind of dog. We can pretend. Okay. Yeah, that's true. Very nice. Okay. Okay. I always find that in our house the remote control always goes missing. It's always, where is the remote control? So maybe if you could have some kind of tracking device for the remote control or some signal that you could find out where it was. I dunno, some kind of alarm. You can press a button on your wall, signal, 'cause it always gets lost. Yeah. Yeah, that you don't use half of them. Yeah, that's, that's Yeah, it is. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. A novelty. Are we going into kind of novelty factors here. Like, I've seen phones like a Okay. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I suppose, if we're he heading to have it, like make a huge profit out of this, it needs to be quite a universally accepted thing. Like, a novelty thing might only sell a few things rather than, like, a general kind of more acceptable But we don't wanna go towards boring, 'cause that wouldn't sell either. So, hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Industrial Designer. That's me. Mm-hmm. Okay. Thank you.
