Hey, Project Manager. What was it, problem? The laptop? It hang hung. Ha-ha. Oh. Project Manager. You're our Project Manager. Master. Master of I'm sorry. Okay. Go on. Yeah but when the power gets low, you have to shake it or something? Uh, and uh uh Hmm. Mm yeah. It's too less space. And when the battery doesn't work, I usually shake it too. So Like slamming on it. It's exactly the same. Hmm. But, are you going to draw it? The Yeah. Yeah. Uh, I c I can't imagine. I can't imagine how how how it looks like. Yeah. Design. Mm-hmm. Uh Oh, okay. Okay. Oh, okay. Okay. Well, I think uh we're going to sell tell ten millions of them. So uh I bet a big company in uh Korea or Taiwan, like uh Samsung, can give us uh a big discount on the chips, so U usually, chips are uh aren't more expensive than one dollar. So That that shouldn't be a real issue, I think. Yeah, a combination. Yeah. Like an uh aku uh Acu uh, yeah. Well,. Yeah. Combine them. Okay. Of course. Fifty cent. Rubber. Rather hard. Yeah. Well, I think that touch-screens are generally square. But it's the case you put around it that makes the shape. Hmm? Yeah okay, but if you have a square uh L_C_D_ screen, and you put a case around it that has uh like bulbs or that that covers part of the L_C_D_ screen. That That's it's custom customisable and Yeah, me too. Mm yeah. Yeah. Can I uh do my thing? It uh Expert map. Okay uh Last week I went to uh Paris and Milan for some trend-watching. For marketing. Our research and development department and I went to Paris and Milan. In Paris and Milan, we uh asked different people, uh differing in age and in income, uh the amount of money to spend, um what they like in design uh and material nowadays. Findings. Our main audience, uh so that's people below forty, uh prefer the following. At first, the colours of fruit. Very basic colours, like Janus explained. Um, fresh colours, uh green, red, uh strawberry red, uh yellow, banana yellow. Um, considering material, um Yeah. They like spongy material, like yeah a sponge-ball. Like a s soft material. Janus m uh mentioned it also. I think he did some uh some findings himself. You wer you weren't in Paris? Okay. Like this. Like big uh g flashy colours. Fresh. It's nice, I think. Okay, our secondary audience, uh people above forty a forty years in age, they like the dark traditional colours. Uh Yeah, uh materials like wood that No n j just j just a w No, okay, but just just a wooden uh look. Like uh you have those fake uh fake panels on the floor. The that isn't wood anyway, but Okay? But, that's our secondary audience. So, uh we decided to take mm yeah the people below forty. So, that this doesn't apply. 'Kay, the third. Uh, there're some overall thoughts about new remote controls. They have to look fancy. Um, they should be technological in innovative. That means uh there have to be fancy things in. Uh, and easy to use. But that's common. My personal preferences. We have to aim at a mu at the main audience. And uh, therefore use fresh colours. Uh, I'll I'll come to that in a second point. Here, think about removable covers, as seen in mobile telephon telephone market. To customise your own remote control. Like the Nokia uh the removable covers, uh just put a red on it and go to the shop and buy a green one. Uh, a third, material being used uh could well be stuff like rubber. Um, two advantages. Uh, it fits within the current market trends. And uh it adds safety to your remote uh when you drop it. So Uh to come back to your question, I think uh and the people in Milan and Paris also think that uh the rubber should be pretty hard. Like uh seen on regular mobile phones. Actually, they have a lot in common. The phones and the Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, exactly. Uh, in my second sheet of personal preferences, uh we have to reconsider the speech function uh recognition. Uh, it's very innovative. Innovative. Yeah, like something. You you can see that the market is just screaming for new technologies, like speak uh speech recognition and stuff. But, we have to keep the cost in uh in mind, but it Yeah, it it can be uh very expensive. 'Kay, second. Uh, building games like Snake or Tetris to amuse the younger users. Uh, also the link with uh mobile phones. Uh No, but No, okay. But you don't use games when you're d when you're making a telephone call. It's just the same. Yeah. When you're at college. Uh No. You al you also take uh t you take your IPac and go uh play games. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I do that, but Okay, and um And third, I stick with it, the log-in functionality uh with the slogan, take parental control to a new dimension. That's it. Yeah. Uh, what do you think about a back-and-forth come-up uh button? L like in uh internet explorer. Yeah okay, but does it that is for uh going from four to five. But if you go from two to eight, and you want Yeah, and on two. That you can switch switch easy. Yeah it is. Yeah. Mm no. That's it. Okay. Yeah. Yeah but What I see uh How I see it is you put it on the the remote and then you have like a Windows log-on screen with parents, children. Something like that. And w when you want to use the parents uh option, you have to Yeah, ok Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Pu push parents. That then then then you have to uh go to three-digit uh log-in. Like two one three. And it's in. It automatically goes Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm yeah. V violent T_V_. Yeah, of course. Yeah. Yeah, w It just has to be w when it's deliver out of the store, it has to be just simple and plain. But if you want to install it personally uh If I got kids, and I could choose between uh two remote controls. One uh w with parent control and one without, and I would would buy the one with. I th Yeah. Yeah. Yeah but yeah but that isn't possible. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah, and And and you know w uh when you install another device, uh children can still go up to the T_V_, p pop open uh the thing and and and g go to a channel. Yeah, yeah of course. But Yeah. Ah it's Yeah. Yeah, okay. But it's just an an added feature feature. Mm yeah. Yeah, like f voice recognition is too much, I think. But games. It doesn't Yeah. That that doesn't c that doesn't co Yeah, that that doesn't cost a lot of extra resources, I think. Yeah, it's it's in it. But too ma I I think so, but Yeah. To put Yeah, to put it in always. Yeah, but T_V_s aren't capable of sending. Yeah? I thought they were just a able to receive. Yeah, some. But Yeah. Yeah, j just some rules. Yeah, okay. But, on the T_V_ at least my T_V_, is a is a compartment which you can press. And there are buttons uh behind it which you can use, if you d if you don't if you don't have a Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, of course. Yeah. Or j Yeah. Ah I have to uh consult my legal advisor about it. Consensus. Oh. Oh. I I have one thing left. Maybe for uh Jerome. Um, the views. Maybe it's uh handy to build in an expert view and a simple view. Yeah. Like at In the experts view, you have a lot of more buttons. Yeah. Mm yeah, okay. Fairly enough. Yeah. Yeah, wh which buttons you like or not. Yeah. Yeah. Just leave the other numbers away. Okay. Go on. A little chat. Marketing. Management. Yeah, that's my function, to Okay. Go on. How I know a marketing name for our product. R_ th R_ to the third power. R_ three. Real Reaction remote. Mm-hmm? Bling. Yeah. Yeah, okay, but it has to be like a split second, because you have to put in a code also and Yeah. Yeah. That spins around like all the time. It it's just like a uh globe in Internet Explorer. Okay. Who uh Who who gave you the master class? Ronald Betenberg? Okay, thanks. Ah. In the master class. Yeah. Me too. Thank you too, lord. 'Kay guys, lot of success.
