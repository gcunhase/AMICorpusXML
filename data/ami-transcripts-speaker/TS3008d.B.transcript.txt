. coffee. Uh, well the uh all the functions are discussed uh I think the most of the functions are uh uh obvious. Uh, it's a little bit. Uh, power button. Uh then the the the nine uh channels. Uh the volume uh uh at the side, and the other side is the programmes. And then we had uh just uh two buttons, we place them in the middle, uh the menu, and for the teletext I thought that was th Oh, the mute button. Yeah. Well, yeah mo uh mo Yeah, well most of them are right-handed. Yeah well, I don't have time in uh anymore on the Oh yeah, just progr programme above, I think. Yeah, true, yeah. Uh Uh I think so. Zero? May maybe here? Yeah. And then a second. Is it depending on television? Yeah. True. But the ex Yeah. You uh you can wai when you push the one you can show on the telly a one and just a dash, and then wait uh two uh seconds or something We'll discuss them in the usability lab. Uh eva evaluation. I don't know uh I don't know if if it's it's necessary. Yeah? Okay. Ach. Yeah. Yeah. Well it yeah, uh there's nothing I think it's pretty basic, the the there's no fu there's one there's one button, that's wha there's there's there's one function and that's n the one button when you want to find it. You can. But i i i it's backwards. But it's it's backwards. It's leaning. It's leaning backwards, I think, in the in the docking station. That's text. lights? Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. No, not fronts. Different designs. Different colours maybe, yeah. We can make it a one. Mm yeah. I agree. Um, I uh I go for the positive. So I go for two. Okay, three. Yeah. Two. One. One. Okay yeah, I'll I'll agree. I'm the I'm the usability, so Yeah. The Well Yeah, well menu Yeah, maybe. Yeah, true. Yeah, I agree. Mm two. Because we got Well. Yeah. Uh, I will I will make it a three, because uh yeah. I I th Yeah. True, yeah. Yeah. No. We're not well, maybe the the the on the side. And the light maybe. But Well, six. No, six. Six. Yeah. Innovative in generally or just f original for A docking station is innova Okay. Six. Yeah, a two. More two. Yes. Yeah, I think two, yeah. I agree. Two. We don't have the slogan though. The logo. Underneath it or something. A three. Three. Yeah, a three. Yeah, two. Two. No. Okay, yeah. Shoot. No. Well, special colour.. I don't Mm okay. Whoa, it's a little That's huge. No. We have the simplest buttons. Uh, one til nine. Is that one or is that nine buttons? Yeah. Is it cents, the the the fifty cents a button? No way. It's way No, no no. Yeah, uh That's still four. Yeah, that's no option, that's no option. A special colour, why a special colour? But wha what s what special? Okay, yeah. Uh, yeah. Plastic. Plastic, I think. Plastic. Yeah. Se no no no. And then we can get a docking station. But what what can we do But uh what can we do with the simple chip and what's difference with a regular chip and a advanced chip? If if i Regular chip and because we don't have uh special functions to use uh in advanced chip, for example. Yeah. We'll go back uh tomorrow. That's the question. If we do i do we need an advanced chip, or is it okay f No. No no, they were uh mine, yeah. Died. Yeah, it's open. It's circuit board. It's only just basics for for At the end circuit there is an infrared LED. Components design. Components design maybe. N on top. Working design. Yeah, but it's the the other one. Was it working design or components design? Chip set. The display requires an advanced chip. Requires. Little lights. Yeah, but that that's just the same as the the LED. Yeah. No. I think uh the uh normal uh simple chip will be okay. Yeah. Yeah, true. Well, that's not too what we want. So, simple chip is okay. Yeah, lights, yeah, there's no category. Can we do it wi within two two Euro? Mm-hmm. But it's original. But then we could make a docking station. Wow, w why no li Look at now, we got two two thirty left. Ca can't we make a docking station of that? I don't know. Well, we we uh Yeah, then we don't have any innovation things. No, we only make less profit of it. No. Cheap remote control. It w it won't tell, but No, uh, n no Yeah, we just have to go all what we did today again. You have to do it over. Yeah. the No, but no. Yeah, yeah. No. Yeah? We can do it here then. Can we can't we do it here? Yeah, we're doing now. But it's. Oh, okay. Nice.
