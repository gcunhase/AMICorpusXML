Uh fourth meeting. Some extra deciding. Well I'll show you the notes again. Very interesting. Well you'll you two will uh present us your prototype. Then um I guess that's your bit? I I didn't s see anything about it, so I already uh thought you uh you were to do that. So the you're uh. I'll show you how we're going to do with financing this uh design. And then we'll evaluate, after after we have redesigned it. Because uh well we'll see about the costs. Um we'll uh evaluate our p our uh production and then uh we can close. Well the finance uh we'll do later, so um firstly uh I'll show you the notes. I don't think it's very interesting. Oh nei. Uh no. Alright. This is copy paste. So Of course. You had some very strange layout. Well um We ge we went through the agenda, and well we had some uh some presentations from you three. And uh I summarised what you said to us. So uh I don't think it's very interesting and go through it again. So uh This is what we decided. It's also copy paste from what we made together. So we still know that. And then uh we can we can uh use the time better. Well uh next you two will uh present uh the pot prototype for us. Yeah. Correct. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah, alright. Okay. Yeah. Alright. Mm-hmm. Alright. So 'Kay. Well if I look at it, the side the side view Oh yeah alright. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. Okay. W Well I see, but Well. Yeah I see it. Yes. When I look at uh when I look at this side view, I think w when I have that in my hand, it's terrible. If if you look if if this this is thick, and this is thin, th th then it that it lies over your hands. But Well what what what I what I agree is that when uh when um you have such of uh an arc in the middle, so that the the a the ends and the fronts is a bit thicker, so th then it falls over your hands. And how large is it? Well uh Well the sides I haven't seen yet, uh? They the the the the the side view, we didn't uh Yeah. No no no. Yep. Okay. Yeah well uh I think uh if you t if you three uh agree then then that's it. Yes. So uh I c I c Well, we'll we we'll do it like this. Alright, if you think that that's the way it should No No, when I I my personal taste is that I want it to fall over my hands with a thick But In the market uh No not totally. For me, I I wouldn't buy it. Let's say it like that. No Yes but Yeah, we don't know, but that's uh that's that's that's more market research. So let it be like this at uh at this moment. Okay? No, I think it's great. Comes to that later. Um you. Uh c You can uh Walter. You can do the evaluation uh criteria on this? That's more useful than just speaking. Yes. Mm-hmm. 'Kay. Yeah, we're we're not quite uh objective about this. To the customers? To potential customers who have to take this questionnaire? Nei. Oh no. I know, I know, I know. But um Well we can go, uh because of the time, uh pretty quick through this. Uh do we find it good-looking? Well we think so. Uh Yeah. Well, one. Well so it's point four. Easy to find t Two. No. I totally agree. We we have to get get on, go through this. No, not false. It's one. Well uh two? Y Well we have to go through it. Yep. Two. Well, no. We didn't implement anything about that. Well six then. Are the functions easy to learn? Well w I we do want we have a l f f less of an And the device R_S_I_ sensitive? Yeah. Ah. Yeah, but just do some We we I th I th I think this is too time consuming. Uh not not towards you, but towards this all. Th this is We you have to put it to the customers. Uh well well a bit, so four. Yes. One. And features included also one. And One. Uh those uh nine uh is the fancy-looking. Uh we still think so. Device fancy feeling. Yeah, cool man. Are there enough technology? Yeah well also we have two. Is the device easy to use? Yes we have not many buttons. Two, three. Are the trends about fruit and vegetables implemented? Well in our covers, in our fronts. So yes, one. Is the material attractive? Oh okay. Okay. Is the material attractive? Well the titanium is strong, and uh the rest f uh the buttons feel soft. So I would say at least two. Okay. Well Yeah. Yes, but we we have to design much more, because there was some irritating account manager coming to me. Um Oh. Uh Yes. Well, look at the costs at this point. I had to fit it in. I twelve and a half. So Well what costs a lot? The sample spea costs four. The sample speaker, the s sensor. Kick it out. We have to go to twelve and a half. The speaker costs far, by far the most. It it isn't worth it. We could make two different versions, one with and one without. But for this So, zero. Then we go to fourteen point six. Well the titanium I don't want to lose actually. L_C_ three? Yeah hand dynamo? Y t come on, w a remote control has a battery. Well be for the L_C_D_ uh you had said. Well what what's the difference between simple and regular? What's the difference between a simple and a regular chip? And simple? Nothing. Well? Your part. What happens if we do How much do we win? One. Yeah. Well, we could say, well this special colour, that isn't that that isn't there, because the the fronts they will buy it. The special colour. Yeah, then you s then you only have one half left. Uh yeah. Yeah. Yeah? No, the advanced chip is needed to have an L_C_D_ display. Says, his Uh that was in the second meeting, I think. Well I I did single curve to Well you said s double curved, uh he, because uh I thought it's a b a bit cheaper already. We can also make it flat. But Curved? Yes, that's curved. Yes. No, it's one curve. One curve, simple. We have a big financial problem. Well, then we have two dollars less profit. Come on, if we if we if we make this fifty million, they won't hesitate to uh congratulate us, so uh By the way, we also have this one. Oh, costs nothing. That's nice. Plastic is Yes, but I just got it. Who? You want to dump the titanium? And make all plastic, then we ha then we're there. Th then you have a ugly, stupid, l ugly looking, dumb remote that that no-one would buy. No, I don't think so. Yes. And the feel, and th that it is strong, and We still we had to focus to get more people from the younger group, but not lose the one Why can't I I'll put in the report we that we think that fourteen point one is the l m lowest price you can make a remote for that's trendy d these days. I I'll talk to the managers. Titanium, I thi I think this this is this is e really good re remote. But Ah those those account managers, what do th d what do they know? Come on. Riot. Yes, yes. One and a half Euros. Hmm? So? Well, no it's just uh all plastic. Well alright. Huh. Four. So But then we can add the special colour? As we have money over uh left. And we still have money left. What do we want, guys? Yes. Y Oh no. Alright. Safe. So alright. Finance? Well, guys? Guys? We have to dump our titanium, and we'll hate the managers for that, but now we're going to evaluate our project, of uh project, project. Well, satisfaction on for example, are we satisfactory about our creativity? I think it's terrible that we got uh those costs at the last moment. That's really bad. But that that that's that, yeah that's a reason, but also for our creativity. We had um nice design, and then you get the cost, and you had to dump all your creativity. Yeah. Well, alright. Uh leadership next. Uh teamwork? Uh yeah well I think so also. I al I I've uh filled that in in a the questionnaires uh each time, so Well the managers were terrible. So, with their all their useless requirements. But o alright, the teamwork? No they said, oh we won't d uh we won't uh use teletext, uh we won't use the D_V_D_. Alright, teamwork? Well great I think. Uh well what do you, what did you think about the SMARTboard? Well It's also a It's both the SMARTboards. I liked this SMARTboard, but I hated that one. Well it's both a SMARTboard. No. It's both a SMARTboard, but this one is used for a desktop, and that one is used to to draw. Well, wi w which one did you like? That one. Yeah. Yes. Th that is so. We're now talking about the SMARTboards. Or install a laptop to a beamer, or have this one standing here in an I I like it. Okay, alright. Yeah. Yeah, it is. So And uh the digi the digital pen? Did uh did you like that one? I used it uh just to check it out, but uh You you can't send that to anyone, because you you've scrabbled something on a page for yourself, and then you're going to send it, yeah. Well, no. It's, no, it it's useless. Yes. For drawings, yes. But But for notes, it i you you have to put that in a strict Uh you have to put a name, standard date, and all those things. And notes uh for a meeting are very strict. So if you uh were to write them down for yourself, and then put that in your computer, you still have to type it over to Word. So it doesn't d doesn't have any Yep. Alright. Um etcetera? Well uh the laptops? Of course great. Yeah. You can. B by my Yeah. Other uh things we used here?

Digital pen is useless. So Yeah, for drawings. But uh two t But uh th then you have to have a lot of drawings, because if I had a company and I'm going to uh buy those expensive huge expensive uh things, I and I have to w pay those uh papers uh that are expensive, I'm not going to uh Well th then still they they they should have a a nice graphics programme on the laptop. Because this is huge uh this v very very uh expensive paper. Yeah. Well no. I hated to draw like that. You you can't draw anything uh neat. I if it if it would be perfect following.
