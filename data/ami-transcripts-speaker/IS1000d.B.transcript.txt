Okay. So. Matthew is uh late again. Probably an important man. Um. So well it is important for him to be here uh. He he he You did work together didn't you? Yes. Yes. Yes. Mm. Um yes but w we Yes, maybe we should phone him. Um well Um, when he is not here we will just we just have to continue. Um so just for record I I will take uh notes again. And um well first thing uh I was uh uh I got an email from uh from my superior again that we really should stay within the budget of the uh twelve Euro and fifty cents. It's uh well he said to me well uh when you stay in it's good, when you don't stay in you have to redesign. There is no uh no negotiation uh possible in this matter. So we have to consider that. Good. Um so maybe Anna, you can have your presentation. Okay Matthew. Nice uh you are here. Great. Great. Oh ma maybe then you can start now with mm presenting your uh your designs. Mm. Eye. Uh-huh. Yes. Ah, okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Exce except for the for the special shape, the surfing board, it has a quite a a conventional layout of buttons uh. Mm-hmm. Yeah no you can carry on, I just look how it feels all. Yes it really feels like like like a mobile phone. Just I'm I really want to talk to it. But. So but but continue with your uh mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. From D_V_D_ player to television or something. Yes. Mm. Yes and and and then you get feedback via the L_C_D_ yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah but but but but uh i in there uh when this is closed, will it also uh cover up the L_C_D_ screen? But but the L_C_D_ screen I mean is a very uh well an eye-attracting feature which shouldn't be shouldn't be That th that's true. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yes. Yes, more robust. Yes okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. But w Mm 'kay. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well well Mm. Be before ta talking about the money and what's possible and what is not possible, maybe Anna you can uh give our uh give us your um Yes. Evalua evaluation and also the evaluation criteria, so what what is important to look at. Mm-hmm. Well just do it quickly if if we al already. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Um, n no why not why not discuss uh discuss it now, Mm, well my my personal view is uh w when when this one is eight Euros we must think how can we improve it. And then I mean w w w you must just see it we can still spend this four and a half Euro and to r because th th th the the selling price is already prite fik uh uh quite fixed on twenty five Euros so we just have to offer as much as as well value for the for the customer uh he can have for twenty five Euro. Mm. Um well w w we can still discuss that. So um, and together with evaluating this uh we we might come with new ideas I mean adding things or uh removing uh of options because they are too expensive, but um I've received uh a framework which we can do this. I mean did you have this this Excel sheet? No okay, this is these are the the the latest prices of our production uh uh production unit for several components, so we can uh see whether the the price is is within the twelve Euro uh fifty cents uh. So maybe we can start with this, uh, calling this one. Th th this is the first design. Yes. Uh there is another pen. Okay. 'Kay. Okay. So. Look and feel. Well you already feel that uh pretty much I think. In i in my opinion purely feel is is is very good, is very good in your hand, so I I I would consider two or or may maybe even one for feel. But that's just half, we should also consider look, and then i it looks quite conventional. Don't you agree? So maybe two. Hmm. Hmm. Ma ma ma ma maybe say say five I It's my opinion, but I don't know what what Four, four. Now we th th then we settle on four. 'Kay. Can you maybe fix the other Mm, try it, just try it. Oh it will not ri mm, mm. Yes, it it has a mm. Good. Good. Okay. So then then Ah. Mm. I I I When we want to include I I I'm doubting about this this component. It it it it breaks in your Mm, yes I see, mm okay. Well r r Mm. I think the look is better but the feel is is is worse. So so I would also say this is four. But w w do you what do you think? Mm. Mm. Yes. Yes, it basically is the same shape. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes, okay. Two? Mm. Two's good yes. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. The only innova innovation is the shape. S so that Mm. Yes. A and the L_C_D_ screen is That's that's that's well it's quite innovative. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. We just diske discuss it as you designed it and then we will will try to get it in the budget. Eight. Yes. Two. Why it is one. A man w w Yes. This this is it w with the speech recognition? Well. Gi given that that it works, then it's I think one. Mm. Hmm. Three, I would. Three. No. Yeah. Yes but then when when he is used to it, i i it is quite easy. So so I think th three is good. Yeah. Good. What's the next? So Twe twenty to forty, yes that's Mm-hmm. Well exce except for the surfing shape. I mean that's that's something which which has an appeal on this group I think, but Mm w w w we after this we can can consider uh for instance, making this more attractive to to the demographic Mm. But as it is now, I w would say mm, six, something. Do you agree? Mm, yeah, indeed. Th t t Ju just think, twenty five Euros, I mean it's not going to be cheaper. Mm. Mm. Okay. Yeah tha tha tha tha tha that's I think it's better, because of the L_C_D_ screen which is really an appeal on the on the on the on the and on the Mm. So, the L_C_D_ screen uh attracts, yes. Because it Mm, ma maybe that's something to consider, yes, so. Wh what what No s say t two. Two? Okay, the final point, trends. Mm. Mm. I think Mm. Mm. And the then we can al yes. We can we can consider uh uh is it possible do you think, to to make a cover for s such a phone? I mean Well just with the with the flexible plastic uh I th I th I think O o or just two things which can be put on each other. Yes, exactly like it. Uh, so Maybe we can but we have to decide it, we can put the the the fancy f look of vegetables for instance, to to these covers and s now try to invest in the in in the features. Mm. Mm mm mm mm mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Yes. So so so that that would make the trends equal, so we we we really have don't have, I mean Mm. Yes, indeed. Yes. Say, say one and two. One and two. So le le let's see. So d this one has spongy but buttons? Mm, I see, yes okay. Good. Just add it. You know. Three, six, seven. Mm-hmm. We we must try to get them closer. Both in i i or we just have to choose. And adapt. Because, when we choose for this one we have to we have to make it more attractive and w when we to d for this one we have to make it more cheap. Yes, well But I'm now did y did you work with the same prices that I have here? Mm. Mm, tha Well yes, well uh re reconsider it. So let's let's try to to model this this phone in this sheet, uh what kind of energy source uh I I we didn't speak about that. It's a it's a normal battery, or Yes. Just so one battery. 'Kay. Electronics. given speech recognition I think w you should go for the less fancy chip. Yeah, yes, or sample sensor, yes. Yes, this one. Okay. Case? Um, I see I Double curve. Mm. Oh yes, we are talking about, but they have the same shape, but, actually bu So th th this would be double curves? 'Kay. Uh, plastic would be the material. Uh special colour, now we leave it to the covers. Push. Mm, yes, but Yeah th now this is per per unit, this number of components. So, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, t Yes. Twelve I believe. So this comes to eighteen. So So I think but th do you agree th that thi Yes I Yes I'm I'm no I'm no I'm not sh sure. Yes I kno undes I understand what you mean, yes. Uh-huh. Both. Yes. Uh W d we have we haven't talk about a, but that's no a is very exp inexpensive I believe but it is not in the list. W ho h is this a scroll wheel or is this a a a sort of button which can be pressed on two sides uh so for higher and lower? Mm. Mm-hmm. So um We're We We could go for the for the for the for the for a simple chip, but then we can't have the the speech recognition, yes? Yes? So so w when we w a this would this would be cutting the speech recognition. Transti Say say it's regular, regular chip, and we still on fifteen, so Yes but that maybe Well we can just say one. Ca l we are just when we just want to uh to cut the number of buttons we have to make seven to to fit in in twelve twelve fifty. So is it possible? Mm-hmm. No no, he he he I I Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Otherwise y you ha you have a s ve very normal uh thing like this. Mm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. A Mm Mm. I I think we have to come to a decision now, just I I think we we what we just do i is vote about the uh the L_C_D_ uh display so Yes. Yes. Yes. One man one vote. S so who thinks the the L_C_D_ disply display should be i should be in it? Mm. Mm-hmm mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, I know, but Yes. So uh uh having an L_C_D_ s display is just uh uh have very very limited amount of buttons. Is that acceptable? Ca can I have can the functions be implement in an You've you you agree. So hav hav having seven buttons, instead of twelve. So that wou would be cutting cutting suh say about these buttons. Mm. Mm. So um I I think we should we should cut the L_C_D_ screen. That that's that's my opinion. Just Uh where, L_C_ Okay w we now we can just uh Yes. Yes. I th I th I think w we just go for this one and that that now twelve Euros is the is is the price, okay. My m my supervisor will be glad that it's fifty cents cheaper than he expected. Okay. Okay, good. Then we the same. Thank you. That was it.
