It's not saved yet. So Our beautiful drawing. Are we doing the the speech recognition? Because we didn't have enough time to uh de um design the inside as well. Okay yeah. Well then then we're gonna put it in. Yeah, just uh we have to design the inside then, but it should be uh It's may maybe uh a bit stronger as well. Okay, so when you have a lot of room inside. So you can make it very easy to use. 'Cause you can write a lot of comments besides it. No. Yeah, we're gonna use the advanced chip then. Advanced chip was for uh spee Yeah. Okay. Good. Together? I'll give comments. Speech recognition. Um I didn't have a specification of that. But um I can imagine that you have to input your voice or something. Um so I've Yes, you need options to configure it, and after that you don't need 'em anymore. Yeah, you can put 'em all on the back. That's for sure. That's uh We also don't know how many buttons are required, or what kind of buttons. But You have a lot of room if you can slide it open. You Yeah I know. I can imagine you need at least four buttons or something. So But it's enough room. Uh well Well the main, the main zap buttons are most central. That was the the most important thing. So uh the best place, the best reach place Um on-off buttons, text buttons, mute buttons are together and at a place they easily are, easy to find. Um the on-off button is a bit bigger, uh so it stands out. That way you don't have to make it red, 'cause it's will uh will show up. Uh scrollwheel is on the left side. It's basically the be standard place for scrollwheel, as far as I know. Yeah. Okay yeah, they Yeah okay. That's that's below that then. It's uh twelve buttons. Yeah okay, just we just missed that. But um I'll just uh I'll get back to later. F the form well, we've taken that from the iPod, other popular technical device. So um should be popular. Um The f uh the buttons creating? Uh if you That or all round shapes, not uh rounded corners. So that, you know, you get a bit round feeling. Um we'll use hard plastic. Since that allows us to use uh two D_ buttons, uh non-rubber buttons. Colour changeable. Well and um the backlight thing, the thing that lights up. We have decided uh in the the channel buttons, there's a little uh colour around it. And also in the num-pads, there's also colour light behind it. So when you pre Yeah. We're going to implement. Yeah. Mm just a little Yeah. Yeah, I um To your video device. Yeah. Is i Ah okay. Um slides I think. It's You can do it that it claps open, but I think that's not solid enough. If that breaks then you're screwed. So it do doesn't even have to slide all the way open. Um Uh i the the speech functions buttons. Menu button. With uh maybe uh arrows. So you can uh scroll in the, navigate the menu. Um I think we can even put a We have one for the zero and one for the for the more digit uh channels. So you have one left for the Right, the video channel, Play Station, etcetera. That's used pretty often. If you have a Play Station, mm you use it every day. That was it. Uh It doesn't really matter. That's Yeah well we don't have any uh Hmm? What else? Uh menu buttons with arrows. S Just uh like Um I think it's best if we do. Mm where do we have Or there. Like on the normal uh Like this. The menu button, yes. Well we don't have any, anything on how many buttons speech requires. So you can't redesign it. Yep. Just press it once, the colour should uh switch. Press again, the colour switch again maybe? Yep. Yeah, maybe some uh some text next to the scroll wheel, that it is volume. I just uh The volume logo. Yeah. Yeah, we have that on the the text button. Uh why not? No Whoa I think um Yeah, the three stages. Yes. No, it doesn't have to turn it off. Just don't Yeah. I dunno if Yeah, I think as well, but Uh yeah. Yeah, in thi the the remote control in the the chip. Yeah, that's true. So yeah. Um do we need to fix that or Just like your telephone, hard plastic. I think just on the buttons. If you do it abo above or below, it takes uh more space. I don't think the space is worth it. Mm. Okay. Well I think we do If it's really uh, if you can if you can get the iPod look, then it's beautiful, I think. Hmm? Um basic colours, um yeah. Well you didn't say. Maybe um company colours? Black. A bit a bit of yellow. Not not not yellow, but just a bit of light yellow. Like white, also ni or uh always nice. Just um Yes. Yeah, grey. Just dark grey I think. Well we have changeable fronts, so So Yeah. It's hard to decide for us, but yeah. It it's At least it's a lot better than uh current remote controls. Yeah. Mm. Not needed. Yeah, not needed I think. Yeah. What do I think is necessary necessary item? Of course it's reachable. Okay, maybe just some light uh to to light it all up. So you can see what's really there. Not just not re on the buttons or something. Just a green light or some blue light. To light it all up. Yeah. Well yeah. Uh semi-transparent. Yeah, w we've done a a lot of detail in light, so Yeah. Yeah. So I think it's easy to use, but And learnable is a bit Well y just uh f Yeah, I think it's very clear what it all does. Yes. But the second parts, uh like speech, etcetera, that will be harder to learn. It's Yeah it's Device. Okay. Maybe three then. Learnable's Yeah okay. Yeah. Yep, true. Then a two. And the scrollwheel, backlights, slide. But also slide that buttons come out, as well? Okay. Yes. Different colours, so Yeah. That would And we didn't uh But then we also have the the home station. We are forgetting about that now, but We don't recharge. But that's more like uh now. I don't know. Uh Just save, save as? Okay. Yeah, it is. Uh untitled? Yeah, it doesn't matter. Save. N Mm. I think we followed the latest trends. Oh right. Well uh fruit and vegetables, yeah. You can different front uh This is a a power indicator. So you can see how far it's charged up. To call. Um Okay. No no, I want that in. Yeah, th the speaker is very small as well, right? Yes uh. Yeah, we can uh Um different fronts, but standard front won't be, yeah. Yeah. This? Oh, them. Is that uh included? In the twelve Euro or Okay, then we then we need to use it. Yeah. Damn, solar cells are uh expensive. Okay. Mm uh i Yeah, I think so. I think uh everyone uh already. So I think we uh discussed a lot of things about it. So Of course there was. Yeah. One leader to check the time, etcetera. So more like a secretary. Uh I think we we got wrong information at the wrong time. I think that was the m biggest problem. Like uh the prices. If we knew that before, we could have uh had discussion really uh s really quicker. Yeah, and if you had uh fifteen Euros, then we would it. We had to Yeah. I think uh everyone listen to each other. Like marketing said things and then we had to i include them in the design. It was Just doesn't work. Well uh smart board would be very uh nice to work with, if it worked really well. Just not work too slow. Yeah, more accurate. Yeah, it's i It should be more accurate. And uh I think it would be great if you could edit it from, just with a mouse, from where you're sitting. Not just pointing out on it. Yeah. No use to draw on the board itself. It's just slows down. Yeah. Yeah, even harder to draw like this than black board style. Yeah. You cou You could draw on it, but not as main function. We did it. New ideas found. Oh I just think if we uh I dunno. For remote control, a favourite for your text. That's for. Yeah, this this is just the idea phase, the Yeah. Details uh Quite early. Oh, what do we have to do now. Do we uh I thought we were done at four o'clock? Yep. Mm we can do it afterwards, so Yeah. I found it as well. One two three four five six seven cameras. Mm not bad. So that was it. This is The old versions. They went for uh for a universal device. Yeah, but also a different device. Then an L_C_D_ uh would be handy. Yeah, and touch screens for all our stuff, yeah. I do agree with that. Yeah, tu-dum. English is not so hard by the way. Well, leader? Project Manager? You do? Yeah, you have to make a choice. Wow, that's pretty quick. Uh uh um You have to decide. It's the lower one. No no, the upper one is the bomb. Yes. I knew it. No. That's too much work. Come on. I challenge you. No, you gotta use the magic pen. Hmm. What if I put one there? We'll see. I don't agree. Yeah, you had two choices. That's gonna be draw. Or not. I'll put it here. You are going to put it there. Then It's a difficult choice, either here or there. Ugly. Oh a pen. Yeah, but Then do it correctly. Stupid, the L_C_D_ screen. What? Okay, I'm going to guess what you're drawing. No no, the new one. Uh they just don't save it. A house? Yeah, you have to use the pen s stupid. No, not everything. Pen, select select pen. Okay. It's a house. A plant? Oh yeah, I can know it. It's a Okay, that makes it easier. I think I know. No, wrong. I think I know what you're trying to draw, but it's wrong already. Yeah, you missed the right side. No, you're wrong, you're wrong See where you're wrong now? The entrance. Alright. You're correct. Yeah, but I think Oh no you made another mistake. No I w Okay, I'm not that whiny. But uh there was a big hole here as well, and there as well. That's a kinda big mistake. Warning, finish meeting now. Guys, I think we have to finish the meeting. Uh? What does it say? Come on. Yep. Oh you gotta finish over there? In your own room? I'm gonna be so lonely. Mm I'll clean that up later. What's that?
