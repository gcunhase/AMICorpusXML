Mm-hmm. Okay. Because it's open you mean. F_ five. Did you draw it? This. What is the other chip for? The one on top. For men. To the in Okay. Mm. What is F_P_G_A_? So why's it how is it different from the Bluetooth? Yeah. Programme it. Okay. Yeah. Uh So this are the they have to work together? Or? Do they have to work together or two separate choice Okay. Is the is the software par alri okay. Okay, okay. So you can control if you want, right? Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. You can put it on the charger when uh you when you don't need to use it. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Mm. Uh mm. Y yeah, yeah. Because you are using because you are using Bluetooth, if some people have P_D_A_ they can use their P_D_A_ to control the T_V_ if they want to, right? I dunno. So is mine. Oh. Yeah, this your Yeah. So you can open uh three. Yeah. So So I'm working on the technical functions design. can you show the next slide. So the the purpose is to to find uh the important questions to ask is what effect should the apparatus have. So so I found on a webs on the internet yeah. I spent a lot of time searching and uh and I found that uh the function of remote control is to send messages to television set. For example switch on, switch off, switch the next channel and so on and so on. So I found two very good prototypes for for this interface from our competitors so can you Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ours is a bit uh different. So these are two example. One is from the other one is from, yeah, uh engineering centr yeah. This is the most competing prototypes I've found. But then uh loo but then I found if you look at you see on the left one there are too many buttons Yeah. O on the right I tried to play with the problem is that uh if I have hundred channels I have uh I have to choo press the other button to choose the hundred channels and I have to compose the number so it's very lousy. So you so you move to the next the next one. Yeah, so I talk about the problem. And then I I look at the user manual they are a hundred pages thick, so we don't want that. So I propose the easy to use uh prototype. You can navigate on T_V_ screen and we can the user's preference and we need to have the T_V_ connected to internet so we end in order to access the T_V_ programmes by X_M_L_ and we need some to do some preprocessing. From the technical aspect, the processing should be done on the T_V_ set than on the on the remote controller, right? And then we the speech recognition as uh Harry says we may just put in we may K_I_V_. Yeah, all the processing is done the T_V_ is a compu has some processing power the Yeah. Yeah because are you just wondering what controller okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So i the processing on on the remote controller so it can u be used in any T_V_, any conventional T_V_ sets? Mm. Okay. N yeah, that's all. The next one? So I come up with a simple design, just keep the v navigation buttons. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Okay, that's all. Mm. Mm. No, because you choose by channel, so you choose by T_V_ program so you don't have hundred channels to choose from. If you go by channel, you don't have to do that. Ah. Ah, a big jump. A mouse or Yeah. Mm. Mm-hmm. Uh it's gonna be small. Yeah. So it'll beep if you wanna find it you just uh shout y h just it just has to re respond to you when you look for the device. I dunno how bu And responds to you, and I- mm. But I think if you to recognise numbers it's a well-studied problem. I if you just recognise uh numbers is a limited you have limited vocabulary Mm. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm. But Mm. Yeah. I no I I think that uh i if we go for quality people may tolerate for high quality and of course comes with uh reasonable cost. Maybe not less, but they may be willing to pay little bit more for comfort, yeah, extra features. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm. What is the teletext? Mm. It is interesting but we are only concerned with the remote controller. So you need s special T_V_ sets to do that? Or it's it's done via this remote controller? It's very complex. Mm. Yeah, then we can conclude that. Yeah. Yeah, but it's quite possible but maybe not in this project. Mm. Mm. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Mm. Mm. Using the T_V_ to access the internet? Or what? I didn't quite understand Yeah, okay. Yeah. The future demand, market demand. The functionality in the future. Alright. Yeah. Because all the T_V_ sets will be digital, right. All the programmes, everything will be in digital than analog. Th the system will change and we have to anticipate for those change. Okay. Thank you.
