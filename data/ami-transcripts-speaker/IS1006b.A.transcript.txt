Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm Mm-mm. Okay. Mm I think it's good, okay. You done a good review. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm mm mm. Okay. That's good point. Okay. So um now I think it's the turn of the the I'm not sure um Of the technical function, so uh what effect Okay. Wait a second. Argh. So you're Okay. Let's go. Oh sorry. Okay. Oh sorry. It's off. It's on. Or you want to go to the kitchen. Mm. Um I see that you target uh several s application not only T_V_ but i like we talk about um universal uh remote control. Yeah. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. S Mm. Since we were targeting a really soon uh uh date for the the the um i issuing of this uh remote control I think we will only concentrate on T_V_ for the moment and then maybe m make it more generalised yeah. Yeah it's it's the same solution, I think. Hmm. Yeah uh on zap it's only next next next next next, yeah. Mm-hmm. Maybe we can make uh different modes for each button and you can change mode zapping mode or uh current chan Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Uh you're finish? Okay.

So um of course like before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal personal coach. Well I think that's all. And we have um maybe we have to we say, only for T_V_, not teletext? Uh I think automatic on off control uh it's not possible. Yeah, maybe in the next uh step if we make it work um. Yeah, implemented. O okay, we can think about that. And um do you see something else? Uh yeah that's Or maybe you want to phone him. Since now all yeah? Think Uh-huh. And uh And it's answered. Clap clap clap it's a good I I think it's universal. What about people without hand? Yeah.
