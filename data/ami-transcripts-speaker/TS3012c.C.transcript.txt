Did you manage? Okay. Ah. Hello. No, just uh ask if if he could manage. I have a lot of new information. Hey, everything alright. Did you manage? Okay. Do you have a lot of new information? Do you have a lot of new information? That's true. Huh. Alright. I have a lot of new information. I have a complete list of uh everything that we can use, all the components that all av available. I have no I still don't have any finance information, but at least we have a lot more to go on now Yep, that's right. Let's see where my presentation is. Okay, um this I mentioned before. Every feature for our remote control needs to have their own operating electronic devices. We need to take care of that. Then warning, uh there has to be a chip in our remote control. And the chip requirements uh needed for a normal button uh is just a simple chip, uh scroll-wheel, and L_C_D_ is an advanced. Of course this is more expensive than this. So we have to decide on that in a minute. The available uh components for energy are, we have a basic battery, a hand an uh dynamo, like in uh old torches. We have a kin uh kinetic provision, then you have to shake the remote control to get the energy. And we have solar cells. I suggest that we uh decide on that one uh immediately. Then I have all lists. So My personal uh fav favourite is the kinetic provision because uh I ha I think so, yes. Yes. Yes. Because I had the information uh you take uh the remote control, you pick it up at least two times a day. So then it's already shaken and gives energy.. Or Think Hmm. Hmm. Other options are solar cells, hand dynamo and basic battery. Only basic battery? Okay, but I think this is not a r. Yeah. Yeah, but I think this rules out our unit our rechargeable unit. This is really a really basic battery, a normal battery. Huh? Okay, that's uh. Okay? Okay, but then we don't offer a re-chargement function. That's what it says. Exactly. Alright. Right. Yep. Next one is curving. Uh we can make a model that has one curve, two or three. And uh uh th uh the shape. Of course uh the more curves the more expensive. Exactly. Yes. Hmm. Hmm. I think one curve is uh fine. More expensive. More difficult to make. Exactly. And I believe even that the r the number of options we have on putting things in it uh goes down with exactly. Material. I have to offer a plastic, rubber, wood or titanium. Uh if we choose plastic, we cannot choose solar cells for energy. If we choose titanium, uh we cannot use more than one curve. But we don't have that so fast. Mm. Mm. Okay. No. But I think wood is not an option either. Okay. Hmm. Okay. My personal thought was uh rubber because I had an email, I believe it was from you, uh f against falling. Hmm. Okay. Uh Mm. Yeah. Mm. I think we have to decide on this anyway. Uh because if we make removeable covers, it has to be one of those mat materials. We have no more than this. So Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Alright. Then I proceed, but I need to know after this meeting. So Interface, uh I have four things to offer, pu uh normal push-buttons of course. Um uh we have a lot of expertise on that one. We have a large history, our company, on push-buttons. Scroll-wheels, uh those can be pushed as well, although that is more expensive. Um liquid crystal colour display and um What is this? Okay, and if we use rubber, I already mentioned that, we can only use rubber buttons. So rubber can only match with rubber. Which one of those are we gonna use? Push-buttons, that's b uh I think basic. Huh. No. I think the channels. Oh. Yeah.. Huh? Huh. Hmm. But Huh? Oh. Ah so but it looks cool. Mm no. Oh. Ah. flashy and yeah. I think would be cool, scroll-wheel. It's not that much uh if we take a normal scroll-wheel without the pushing, then it's not expensive. We can do that. Think. Ah we don't need it, but it's uh it's design a design thing. I think they are looking for that. Of course we have uh a young target group. So they might find that attractive in a remote con Okay. So push-buttons we will use. Uh L_C_D_ screen? Is that s Uh I only know that if we are using that, we need ano uh an advanced chip in it. And that is more expensive. I have no idea. I have no absolute numbers. I only have Yeah, but I don't think room is really an issue. Mm-hmm. Okay. Electronics, uh the first one is the chip. Uh that's no longer an option, it has to be an advanced one now. 'Cause we have the L_C_D_ screen. Then we have an infrared sender, I think that's basic, we cannot do without. Otherwise it's not s a remote control. And we have the sample sensor and speaker, the voice recognition thing. Are we gonna do that or not? I only have uh uh relative information. Oh how did you That goes also for the scroll-wheel, by the way. Hmm. Yeah. Hmm. But don't we have any w uh information about scroll-wheel? Scroll-wheel. If people would like that. That's strange, because that's the same story. It's it's not necessary like an L_C_D_, but it's just it adds something to the design. Hmm. No. Oh that's r But I think uh we now already have to uh implement uh an advanced chip. So it's m No, but that's that's okay. There is still time. Yes, this was uh the last M_S_. I have a clear picture. Hmm. Hmm, I agree. Hmm. Hmm. No. Yeah, uh I agree. Okay, agreement. Mm-hmm. That's true. Hmm. Hmm. Oh, that's true. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. But I think, according to my information, this would be two curves. We have one left and one right, and that disables what was it again? It's some it's something that we cannot do then. Okay, that's not a problem. That's only for the titanium. We don't have. Yes. Then w yeah, but we don't have that. So we have We have no. But they uh They th these wha are what they call the curves. This side, this side, this is how they count. No no. This is what they uh what they mean. Okay, that's not really a good. It's like this. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Yep. So I can uh qui oh. I can quickly make a conclusion of what we have decided so far. Hmm. Hmm. Me too. Hmm. Hmm. I would prefer round. But doesn't matter, doesn't matter. That's not a big deal, think. Hmm. Hmm. Huh. It can be curved. Yes. I would curve the whole actually. I would curve the whole. Like um like it hangs over your hand a little bit. Then it will bounce and you don't drop it so easily. Yeah, something like that, yes. Yes, exactly. I think continue like that. Then there's also enough room for the electronics. Yeah. Let's make it yellow then. Uh Maybe once we can make a special edition in according with Chiquita. Have ourselves sponsored. Uh but it's a good trade-off for them if they can have their logo on it. Mm-hmm. They might wanna be the first ones to uh Oh, perhaps they can use it. Or give a special edition uh with with Mm. I think this is possible. Huh. It doesn't matter. You can actually uh place a chip for the L_C_D_ screen and at the bottom, and and wire it. Doesn't matter. I think on top. Mm-hmm. It is, I believe, also able to talk. I have a sample uh sample sensor and the speaker sensor. Uh the speaker sensor we already have, but s I don't know what they exactly mean by a sample sensor. Could it talk back? Like uh g uh give confirmation or something. I think it can. I think if you have a a speech recognition component, then a s speaking component is not that hard to to put in either. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. But Mm-hmm. Yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Mm. Hmm. We already have a sound component, by the way, for the beep. So beep. Hmm. I'm not sure. I should be getting new information, I guess. Yes. But we have any company logo. We have yes, but and yellow. I would change. I would take a yellow remote control. To have it flashy, to have it it's for young people. Need do be different. Hmm. But we need to be different. Mm-hmm. Huh. It's either black cover with yellow buttons or vice versa. And I would say take a yellow cover and black buttons. To be different. Yeah, we have so many colours already. So Oh no, that I think it's good thing to be different than Well Mm-hmm. I still don't have my scroll-wheel though. Uh that's Nah, that's true. No, forget it. No look, it No, that's not my point. It's not because it's functional, but it's just to add to the design, to have it flashy. It it has no function, I agree. I agree. Oh, so many things have no function, just design. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Let's vote on it. Then we don't have to talk about it any longer. What do you want? In or out? Okay. You are out of course. You are okay, clear. I have all my answers, yes. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. There is I have one question. Hmm. Hmm. I only have one question with the material, but I don't have information that. We've chosen rubber. No, but can we make yellow rubber? I think so Okay. Mm. Okay. Hmm.
