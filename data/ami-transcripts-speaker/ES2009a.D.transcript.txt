Expert. Fine. That's me. So. So do we have to wait for you to write it down or are you gonna tell us? I'm waiting to know. Uh Fair enough. Oh, Smallville. I went to high school with Tom Willing actually. The guy. Yeah. Yeah. Very much so. Hell of a soccer player but a total bastard nonetheless. Yeah. He is a big guy. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Good call. Interesting. I guess I'll go next then. Okay. Don't wanna lose all my mikes, plugged in here. Okay. This is basically just pen practice huh? Okay. Oh you're much taller than me so I'm gonna write down here. Um. Right now I'm listening to a lot of somebody nobody's ever heard of, Chris Bathgate, local Michigan folk singer, really lame and uh uh what else did I bring with me? Probably classical, to totally geek it out, yeah I think. And my family guy D_V_D_s but we don't need to write that one down. So yeah. No. Are you getting it online, or is it on sky? Yeah, that'd be nice. 'Fraid not. Mm. Exciting. That'd be. Oh. I didn't even read those. Oops. I shouldn't admit that. Yeah. It's the five by five, I can't read that much. Yeah oh it's so horrible. Oh my God. Seriously? It really is Yeah. Slide it in there. Yeah. Yeah fair enough. I've already got more than I can keep track of. And I'm gonna go home next week and everyone's gonna be like oh my God you're turning into one of those people, no. I know. I know. Oh it should be interesting. Wait until I tell them I'm not coming back. They're gonna love that one. Probably. Or at least get a work visa for a while and then decide. 'Cause nice. Of course.

What they're looking for. And negotiate that. Uh. I don't think there's any rules about it yet. So Yeah. Mm. W yeah. I like the little cover thingies. Hmm. Good idea. Start your minutes. Um Well it's pretty much given it's gonna be universal right, we decided that already and it may be functioning for other things, as soon as you said that I was thinking like all the other things you could get a remote to do, like your microwave or your front door or like to have everything on one thing, but then, I've never been a fan of those huge remotes that have like a million buttons, you can't tell what they do. Yeah. Specific. Okay. Interesting. True. Mm. Mm. Right. We want it to be munt multifunctional but at the same time if you get it to do too much you're not gonna be able to tell them apart, that whole yeah. Hmm. Mm. An interesting option. Yeah. Definitely. Right. That Yeah. Awesome. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Keeping it nice and slick, would be important. And I don't know, like, there's such a problem with losing them, that adding this whole like P_D_A_ pen business is only one more thing to lose, so we're gonna have to be careful with what like Just something like keep in mind when we start actually dealing with this stuff but that would be really cool.
