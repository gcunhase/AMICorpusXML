I'm Louisa. I'm the User Interface Designer. I'm not exactly sure what you mean by tool training. I don't mind. Um. Let's see. Good job I got pockets today. Are we supposed to do this right now, do you think, or? Oh. Right here we go. Okay. I think that I would have to say that my favourite animal is the cat. Little smiley cat there. Um and this would be because they're very independent, uh they're very intelligent, compared to dogs maybe. Um and they can be very very affectionate. Some people don't think so but I know very affectionate cats. Um. Um and they can look after themselves. Shall I rub that out, actually? That's quite good. Can I just check? Is this just a television remote? Because a lot of um systems are kind of T_V_ video combined now, or T_V_ D_V_D_ combined. And one of the most annoying things is having like five remotes in the house. So if you've got a combined system, it could be a combined remote. Or is it just a television that we're supposed to be doing? Comes to your whistle. I think that might be back to the start. Um if you grab the kind of uh slide to the left and pull it down? I'm not exactly clear on what we're designing the rem remote for. Is this a mun multi-functional one or do we decide that ourselves as we go away and work on it? Right. Okay.
