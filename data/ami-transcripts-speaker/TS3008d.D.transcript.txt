. Alright, I Yeah. Alright, and uh you gotta point out which is the volume um uh button and which is the programme button. Yeah, but you you gotta make it clear on the on Yeah, and a and a triangle on that. Yes. Next to that I kinda miss a zero actually. All n no, that's um kinda dependent on the television. I think Yeah, I think you should add A cross, or whatever. Yeah, line. No, that's dependent on the television. I do know so. Yeah. Yes, but uh uh no uh remote control nowadays are um they come with the television. Or actually, the other way around. But Yeah. Yeah, well but su If No no no. So some television respond differently. Look, if uh i i Yes. Yes, that's true. No No, it it it works uh if you haven't got uh a special button for it, uh if you push a one, then on your television there will appear a one and a a line, which is an empty space. Yep. True. No, s some some televisions need the input first uh and and you c No, that's not true. It's simply not true. It's simply not true. Uh No, remote control doesn't give signal after five seconds. Remote control is a stupid thing. If you push a button, it sends it immediately to to the television. No, definitely not. Definitely not. Yes. Uh, you can access that uh via zero, and then minus, I guess. Yeah. Yep. Okay. I kinda miss the docking station. No nothing really trendy about it. The button. Yep. I think that's very difficult, because of different shapes of uh uh devices. Yeah, of course. Mm-hmm. Well it it got it it has got to fit into the shape, of course. The technology and the voltage can be the same. That's uh that's true. But uh i if you all make the m having a bottom like this, then they all fit. Yeah, that's true, but uh Yes, but uh I I g Shouldn't it fall then? It isn't going to fall down? That's a bit uh yeah, I think No, but if if like this, I'll I'll point it out, if you got uh a a a base a base like this, I won't draw it really. If you got a base which is uh as big as this Yeah sure, but if you got if you got a tiny player, it can Yeah. Uh, wha what you could do if you uh from the bottom oh, right, help. Uh, you could make like a hole in it, you know, of uh in in the Yeah. That i that is possible, yep. Yeah, sure, you're right. Oh. I don't like the colours. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Alright. The light. Okay. And other lights? No, o on the on the front. Yeah, okay. Maybe the uh the logo. Yeah, why not? Of course. Okay. Uh, in the same colour as the side. Yeah, I think I think that'll be good. Yes. Yep. Yeah. We will. Well, uh yeah, I I'm gonna do something right there, yeah. We gotta do that on the right the most right-most screen, because the leftmost Yep, that's me. Alright. I will be needing that image, so leave it please. Um Go away. Right, we're gonna evaluate that design according to a few points. Um, we g the four of us are going to do that um together. I wanna have a colour over here, come on. Right, the remote is not ugly, a bit weird sentence, but the positive things has to be on the left, so I said not ugly instead of ugly. Uh, what would you say, we we gotta give points to uh to all of these to evaluate uh that design, and please forget the drawing skills of these guys. The remote control is not ugly. How do you feel? Yes. Background colour. How do you guys feel? The different designs. Yes. Okay. No, not not fronts, but different designs. And that's still uh uh, yeah, is is uh is a little personal touch, I guess. What? Yeah, wha wha what would you uh guys uh think? Personally. Personally. Yes, but what is it? Guido? Two or three. I was I was thinking about three, so I guess three is uh a bit uh oh, what am I doing? I'll mark it. The remote control's uh uh that n makes uh zapping easy. Yeah? Antek, you agree? Yeah. You're not Antek. I totally agree. The remote control the remote control's relevant buttons are prominently visible. Yeah, I yeah. I would say a one because uh every button is uh uh relevant. And our oh yeah, it's a b yeah. Yeah? Alright. That's a one? You agree? The remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons. I think we totally succeeded there. Oh Yeah, that's true. That's true. the the yeah, m well, you d you've got a point. Two or three? Two? Antek. Nay that that that's true, that's true. They're definitely needed. So we put it on a two? The remote control has got a really trendy look. Maarten. Yeah. Ever, yeah. Guido. Yeah, uh I agree. I agree. I was planning to give it a two, uh where I give the not ugly uh oh, yeah, that's true. You agree on the two? Great. Remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons. Uh, I copied that one. Well, uh forget that. Um Go away. Remote control has got innovative technology implanted. Yeah, and the light. Well, I g It's not seven? Why uh why not a seven? How? Yeah, you think the lights are innovative? Well, it's n true. Uh, I agree, m but I'll Yeah, you you didn't draw the docking station. Yeah, it it's I think I think with its I think more m Uh that that's n No uh, well, the agenda says evaluate now, so I think we It's it's a six. That m f Yeah, for the retrieval function. Yeah. I think that's very innovative for a remote control. Yeah sure, but But I d I definitely don't think it's a five, but Remote control is easy to use. I think a two. Yeah? Come on. The remote control hasn't got uh. I've just filled uh Go away. I found twelve questions so much, but it still is ten. It will be bought by people under the age of forty. No no no. No, just if they if they buy it. Yeah, what do you think? Antek? No, that's no comparison. And I don't mean two people. W w Right, the rem The remote control has recognisable corporate image, colour, logo or slogan. Oh, the slogan. Can we see the slogan? Are we gonna do that? Three? I agree. Because of the slogan Remote control's got a basic design intended uh for novice users. Two? Two. Alright. We gotta add up the scores now to see our total average. Four, five, seven, nine. Forget that. Fifteen, seventeen, twenty one, twenty four, twenty six. Twenty six. It's a two point six. Alright, we yeah. Yeah. True. This was my evaluation. So We did a pretty nice job until now. Um, is this your Whatever. Well, I think we gotta fill out another questionnaire. Yeah. A five. A five. Doesn't matter. We probably will. The amount, yeah. I don't know I haven't got an idea on on which we need to use, really. Yeah. Yeah. And how do you know? I mean, you got that email. Did it point out what to use them for? Alright, well, point out the advanced chip for now, I guess. I don't know. I don't know if it's very special. Alright, that's okay. No. I don't think so, because it says amount. The the the yellow row is the amount of To n that's total of four buttons. I think that Eighteen. One two three four five, si Fifty cents for one single stupid button. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. I can't I I I couldn't understand it if it was fifty cents per uh uh per button. Really. Yeah, yeah, No, really. Yeah, but I d I wouldn't want to own that. Really. Yeah. I don't think the special form is really true. Is it? Yeah, I dunno. Plastic. No. Yeah, I really don't get it. I mean if it's a simple chip, then we suddenly got two Euros and thirty cents. Yeah, yep. I think so, too. Oh, I don't know. Uh why? I mean i i if you if it would cost two Euros, that had a total a total thing, it would be nice too, I mean uh we're not gonna add uh a trip to Hawaii to it. I like the hand dynamo part. We can make a plain docking station for two Euros. I mean Wi wi without recharge Yeah, but but we can make a docking station for two Euros uh if you don't put the recharge function in it. I mean, it has a shape. Of course it has a shape, but i i Why should that not be possible? No, for for the uh for the docking station if you do if you choose the simple chip. Yes. Dead. Reanimate it. What the hell are these? Oh, whatever. This isn't helpful. No, that was my presentation. It's already open. It's at the bottom. It's uh at your task bar. Oh. Sorry. Okay, sorry. Yeah, nice. I it doesn't say anything. That's not needed. A display uh is, of course, uh for showing letters. For showing text. I don't think that uh just a l a little light Yeah, I agree. Yeah, I guess so too. Next channel. No. Well, we might want it, but Yeah. Great. Delete. Yeah. Well, there're three, I guess. I think we can make a docking station. Yeah. No, that's true. M bu Or the hand dynamo dynamo Yeah. Yeah, but but if we ca I don't know if Five minutes. That's not true. We can make a docking station for two thirty. Two thirty. We can make a docking station. Sure. Sure. The power device is is i i is very cheap. That's just a regular uh power cable and whatever. So. Yeah. Well then it's a useless project. Can't we uh Can't we say fifteen Euros? No, sta yeah I mean No. You can sell for twenty seven and a half. Then you make as much profit as you would with twelve and a half production costs. I don't think No. Thirteen twenty. And I think only Yeah, but only kinetic, then you gotta You you gotta throw uh throw it through the room like twenty times an hour, really. No. Yeah, it's funny for a week. I guess something like that, where you have to move it around very frequently, is demotivating. No, I I don't move my uh my remote control very much, seriously. Well, we've got more than fifty Cents. Yeah. No, we won't, but that's um something else. No, this not gonna sell. No. Of course not. We come back tomorrow, okay? We can't do anything else. Warning, finish meeting now. Yeah, sure. No, we can't. Yes, yes. Celebration. I don't see why, but I think we gotta fill out another questionnaire, to be honest. No, not yet. Alright, I'll see you guys in a minute. I don't think so. I don't know. I don't I don't think so.
