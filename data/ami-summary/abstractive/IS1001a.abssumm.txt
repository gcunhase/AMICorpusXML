The Project Manager introduced the project to the group and gave a timeline for the project. The group trained themselves to use the meeting room tools by drawing on the whiteboard. The Project Manager presented the project budget and the projected price point and profit goals. The group discussed several of their initial ideas for the features of the product. They discussed making the remote able to control multiple devices, protection from water or from dropping the remote, and a locator function. The Project Manager then instructed the User Interface Designer to research users' requirements, and instructed the Industrial and User Interface Designers to research the functions and usability features that were discussed in the meeting.
