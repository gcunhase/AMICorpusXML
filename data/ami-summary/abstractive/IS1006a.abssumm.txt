The project manager opened the meeting and introduced the upcoming project to the team members. The team members then participated in an exercise in which each team member drew his favorite animal and discussed why he liked the particular animal. After the drawing exercise, the project manager discussed selling prices and production costs for the remote the team will design. The project manager also indicated that the remote will be sold internationally and that two million remotes are expected to be sold. The team then discussed their experiences using remotes in the past and what features to consider implementing in the remote they will produce. The team members discussed child proof capabilities, color options, how to adapt a remote for left-handed users, a "go back" function, the size of a remote, buttons, and LCD screens. The project manager closed the meeting and gave the team members their assignments and then one of the team members briefly went over his role on the team.
