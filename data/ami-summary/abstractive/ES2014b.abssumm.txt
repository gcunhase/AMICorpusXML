The Project Manager gave the group new requirements on product features. The Industrial Designer gave a presentation on the working design of the device. He presented all the necessary internal components and how they operate together. He gave his preferences on energy sources and senders. The User Interface Designer presented the necessary functions of the remote, then compared the interfaces of two existing remotes. The group discussed making their remote more user-friendly; they proposed eliminating rarely-used buttons and making it easier to skip through channels. The Marketing Expert discussed user requirements with the group and showed that users wanted a fancier, less complicated remote that would not be easily lost. He suggested incorporating a menu and an LCD screen to satisfy these requirements. The group discussed how to incorporate a locator function. The Project Manager reminded the group to limit the number of complicated features due to the project's time constraints. The group had a discussion to decide on product features. They decided to include a clapping locator function and a device that allows the user to enter two numbers separately to get a two-digit number. Complicated functions will be hidden in a back panel.
