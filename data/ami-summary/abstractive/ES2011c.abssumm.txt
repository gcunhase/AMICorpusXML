The Project Manager reviewed the minutes from the previous meeting. The Industrial Designer gave her presentation on components and discussed which would have to be custom-made and which were standard. She also discussed the various materials and chips available. The Marketing Expert presented current trends in the market and in fashion. She discussed the current fruits and vegetables trend and the trend toward softer, spongier materials. The User Interface Designer discussed the look of the remote with the group. They discussed including a touch-based graphical user interface but noted that it was unnecessary and costly. They discussed using the menu function on the television instead. The group discussed how the menu function would be programmed. The group then talked about the casing of the device, and decided that there would be a changeable outer casing. They discussed including fruit colors in addition to the company colors. Some part of the casing will be made of a spongy material. The group also discussed energy source options and chips. The Project Manager instructed the User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer to construct the prototype and the Marketing Expert to work on the prototype evaluation.
