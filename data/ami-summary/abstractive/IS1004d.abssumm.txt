The project manager goes through the minutes of the last meeting. They have the prototype presentation and talk about the final design, features, and power source, type of chip and weight of the remote. They go through the evaulations, using the a list of criteria made by the marketing expert. They rate each criteria on a scale of 0 (true) to 7 (false): how fancy it is, how handy it is, how functional, how cool it is, whether they would spend twenty five euro for it, and whether they would change their current remote for this one. Next they do a cost estimate for production. In doing this, they decide against solar cells and go with the rechargable batteries. They keep the regular chip, stick with plastic, put two scroll wheels and three push buttons, and make it a special shade of yellow. They eliminate the turbo button and give the remote a single curve because of budget restrictions. They briefly evaulate the project process and close the meeting.
