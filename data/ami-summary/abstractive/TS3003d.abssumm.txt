In the detailed design meeting the team created a prototype. Along with buttons for numbers, channel selector, volume, mute, on-off, teletext, and subtitles, the prototype included an LCD screen and a help button for functional information. One rechargable battery, single-curve form and plastic case, brought the total cost to 17 Euros. To reduce this cost, it was decided to replace most buttons with a scrollwheel. The remaining buttons were one for channel selection, one for volume (both assisted by the scrollwheel), teletext, on-off and the help button. A suggestion to target the product to a younger or perhaps more general group was met with approval. All these components were re-arranged in a revised prototype. It was evaluated on a scale from 1 to 7 on the basis of the following criteria: fancy design (6), technological innovation (4), functionality (7), consideration of the target group (3). The remote was also recognisable as a fashionable Real Reaction product. The project process was deemed well-structured, although everyone thought it would have been better had they known the component prices at an earlier stage. Teamword and leadership were good, but room for creativity impeded by budget constraints.
