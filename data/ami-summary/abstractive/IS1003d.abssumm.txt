The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented their prototype for the remote. The prototype was yellow and red and was shaped like a mushroom. The team then conducted a product evaluation of the prototype. Overall, the team found the prototype to be technologically innovative but had some issues with the prototype's appearance and its usability. The team decided that the prototype required further work. The team then discussed the production costs of the remote and what features they should retain or lose in order to maintain their target cost. In discussing the production costs, the team settled on what features they wanted in the remote, while staying within the boundaries of their budget, and decided it was not necessary to completely redesign their product. The team then engaged in a project evaluation in which the team discussed the process of creating their product.
