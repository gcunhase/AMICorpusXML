There are some new requirements for the project: the device will have to be for TV only, they should ignore the teletext function, as it is dated, and, also, the remote should be recognisable as a Real Reaction product. The target group will be people below 40. The UI preferred an easy-to-use remote to a multi-function one. The function of the remote is relatively simple: by pressing a button a current is passed to the chip, and defines what signal is to be sent to the receiver (the TV) via infrared. The use of infrared, energy-efficient power source and cheap circuit was suggested. The remote could light up via LED's placed inside. Functions like zapping are very prevalent, as well as complaints about remotes being easy to lose. It also transpires that customers like innovative technology like speech recognition. The design can focus on such customer needs, like finding a mechanism to locate a lost remote. The functions of the remote will include a back button to switch between two channels, volume, program selection, and speech recognition, with a focus on simplicity of design.
