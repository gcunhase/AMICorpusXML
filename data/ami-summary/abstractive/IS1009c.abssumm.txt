The project manager opens the meeting by going over the minutes of the last meeting. The interface specialist begins her presentation by highlighting important remote functions and showing examples of remote interfaces. The group comments on her presentation, and then the industrial designer begins presenting. She talks about the technical electronic components of the remote, explains how a remote works, and shows a few pictures revealing the insides of a normal remote control. She suggests giving the remote a strong shell so it is durable, using a rechargable battery, and not adding a scroll wheel because it requires a sophisticated chip. The marketing expert presents, talking about user preferences for a small, simple, eye-catching, cute, appealing, and functional remote. Fruit and vegetable shapes are popular this year, so a soft, spongy remote perhaps covered with cloth could make the item marketable. The group discusses the issues surrounding speech recognition, noting that if it is good quality it could be costly. They about the power source and review the objectives of the product. The project manager closes the meeting by telling each member what task she is to complete.
