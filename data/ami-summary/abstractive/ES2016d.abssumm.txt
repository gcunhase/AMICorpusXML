The project manager opened the meeting and read the minutes of the previous meeting. The industrial designer and user interface designer presented the prototype they created, which was designed to look like a banana. The marketing expert conducted an evaluation of the prototype. The team found that, although the overall design of the prototype was attractive, its yellow color was ugly. The team rated the prototype highly on its ease of use and felt that its yellow color and shape detracted slightly from its ability to be misplaced and that a feature which causes the remote to make noise based on its proximity to a television needed to be added. The team thought the prototype was fashionable and not technologically innovative or spongy. The project manager led the team in calculating the production costs of the remote and ensuring that they aligned with the project budget. The costs were over budget, so the team opted to exclude the LCD from their design to meet their budget. The team conducted an evaluation of the project process and found that they performed well and were somewhat satisfied by the resources available to them.
