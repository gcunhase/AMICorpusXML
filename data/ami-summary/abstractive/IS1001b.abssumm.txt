The User Interface Designer presented the major components of the interface design, dividing the interface into two parts: voice commands and buttons. The Marketing Expert went over users' requirements as seen in a company study and showed that the major complaint was that remotes were too difficult to use. She also showed that users want fancier and more ergonomic designs, shock protection, voice recognition, and LCD screens. The Project Manager announced a new requirement to the group, that the remote is only to control televisions. The Industrial Designer gave a layout of the internal functions of the device and showed that a standard chip, instead of a larger one that would accomodate voice recognition, would be the most feasible. The Project Manager announced also that the group was not to include a teletext function and that they should integrate the company logo into the external design. The group decided on what button functions should be included and decided to eliminate the LCD screen and voice recognition from the design due to time and cost restraints.
