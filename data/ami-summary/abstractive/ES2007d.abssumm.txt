The interface specialist and industrial designer presented their prototype to the team and discussed the features the prototype contained. In presenting the prototype, the issue arose that the prototype could only be used with the right hand. The team then looked at the production costs of the remote and found that their remote was actually under budget and that they could retain all the features they had originally decided upon without exceeding the target cost. The team evaluated the prototype on the basis of its look and feel, technological innovation, ease of use, costs, and its ability to be misplaced. Overall, the prototype performed very well in meeting all the criteria of the evaluation. The team then evaluated the project process, finding that they we
re happy with their product and their performance in the project.
