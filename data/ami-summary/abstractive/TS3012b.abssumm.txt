Customers are willing to pay more for fancier looking remotes. They like innovative technology like speech recognition and LCD screens. It also transpires that remotes are easy to lose. Everyone agreed that they need to incorporate a locating mechanism in their design, and that changeable covers could make appealing-looking remotes. The need for clarity of button functions was mentioned. On the other hand, materials should be more durable. The function of the remote is relatively simple: by pressing a button a current is passed to the chip, and defines what signal is to be sent to the receiver (the TV) via infrared. There are some new requirements: the target group will be people below 40, the device will have to be for TV only, they should ignore the teletext function, and, also, the remote should be recognisable as a Real Reaction product. They drew some of their ideas, and discussed the positioning of the buttons and the LCD. The most used buttons are going to be placed on top. It might be possible to use a charger for the remote. The concept of the design will be finalised in the next meeting.
