The project manager opened the meeting and went over the minutes of the previous meeting. The marketing expert presented findings from trend watching reports and discussed her personal preferences in how to incorporate the results of the trend watching reports into the appearance of the remote. The trend watching reports indicated that products need to reflect a fruit and vegetable theme, sponginess, fanciness, and technological innovation. The team then discussed their target group and whether to use titanium or a spongy material in their design. The industrial designer discussed options for energy sources, materials, case shapes, and interface components such as buttons and LCD screens. The user interface designer examined the interfaces of existing products and discussed using menus within an interface using push buttons which operate like a scroll wheel. The team then discussed and made decisions on what energy sources, chips, case materials, and buttons to use.
