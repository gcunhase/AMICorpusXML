The Project Manager went over new requirements for the project: that the device was solely to control television, and that there would not be a teletext component. The Industrial Designer gave his presentation on the basic components of a remote control device, and advised the group to use plastic for the casing material instead of metal. The User Interface Designer presented the technical functions of remote controls and compared the interfaces of two existing remote control products. The Marketing Expert made a presentation of the needs and the desires of the consumer and emphasized simplicity as one of the most desired features. The group discussed in more detail the features that will be added to the device: the possible applications of voice recognition, the touch screen menu interface, faceplates, and the look of the company logo.
