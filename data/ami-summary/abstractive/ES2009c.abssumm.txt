The Industrial Designer presented an analysis of cost and the manufacturing options that were available to the group. The Marketing Expert presented market trends and the organic trend that this project would adopt. She discussed materials that could be used to follow this trend. The User Interface Designer presented several interface concepts including voice recognition, a spinning wheel design, and a touch screen interface. The group then discussed the features of the device. They discussed the costs and benefits of using either voice recognition or the touch screen interface, and decided on voice recognition based on their marketing data that favored it. They decided to use solar power to power the device. The group discussed the non-traditional look the device could have since the voice recognition would allow it to be stationary. They discussed using rubber for the case. The group talked about hiding the complicated functions from the main interface, using rubber for the buttons, and having different cases to suit different tastes. The Project Manager reiterated that the product was being marketed towards the youth market, and then gave out assignments and instructed the group to work together to build the prototype.
