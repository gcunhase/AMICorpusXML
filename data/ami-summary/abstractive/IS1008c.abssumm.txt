The Industrial Designer gave her components concept presentation, which presented the components that will be used and how they will be integrated into the functional design. She announced that their only choice for casing material was wood, so she suggested an idea of having customizable wood cases. The User Interface Designer gave her presentation on the user interface concept for the product, and gave a basic layout of the remote's key functions. The Marketing Expert presented the marketing concept and discussed including a display to facilitate use. The group discussed the unique, custom design of the remote, and quickly talked about finding a manufacturer that could make the custom cases cheaply that still paid fair wages. The group also discussed whether or not to incorporate the display into the design, and decided to wait until the cost of adding that feature was known before adding it to the design. The Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer were instructed to begin building a prototype, and the Marketing Expert was instructed to work on the marketing strategy as well as research the cost of the display component.
