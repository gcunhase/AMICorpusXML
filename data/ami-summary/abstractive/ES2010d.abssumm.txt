The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented the prototype and displayed its gunmetal color, removable casing, buttons, logo, and ergonomic design. The Marketing Expert gave an evaluation of the prototype using the group's initial criteria for the remote. The group decided that enough of their initial ideas and criteria for the remote were satisfied to be able to continue with the project. The Project Manager analyzed the final production cost; the cost was lower than initially projected, at 11.2 Euros. The group decided to use one lithium battery instead of several triple A alkaline batteries. The Project Manager then led a discussion on the project process. The group felt that they worked well together and were pleased with the prototype. They complained, though, that they felt constrained by the management's directives, that they had difficulties using the meeting-room equipment, and that they did not have internet access during the project. All participants were instructed to fill out a final questionnaire.
