The project manager opened the meeting and went over the agenda. The user interface designer and the industrial designer presented their prototype design, describing the shape and layout of the remote. The group discussed colour options and decided to make the standard remote in fruity colours, but with the option of buying different exchangeable covers which might appeal more to older buyers. The marketing expert led the prototype evaluation and the group were happy with their product. The group calculated the production costs. The group were 4 euros over budget, so they decided to make the case single-curved and not to use kinetic energy. The project manager led the evaluation of the project process. The group felt that only the industrial designer and the user interface designer were able to be creative and work as a team. It was felt that the first meeting was disorganised because of poor leadership but the leadership improved in the later meetings. The group were also had problems with the digital pens. The group helped the project manager fill in the final report before the close of the meeting.
