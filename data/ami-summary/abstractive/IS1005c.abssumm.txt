The marketing expert discussed his findings from trend watching reports. He found that current trends are such that a product must have a fancy look and feel, be technologically innovative, be easy to use, incorporate a fruit and vegetable motif, and must be spongy. The user interface designer discussed how to create an interface for a remote that is easy to use. The user interface designer discussed the placement of commonly used buttons, the overall shape of a remote, and how to hide less commonly used buttons. The industrial designer discussed various components and energy sources the remote could include. The industrial designer focused on the use of a TFT screen and the use of solar cells to supplement the energy from two regular batteries. The team then discussed and made decisions regarding the option to use solar cells, the specifications of an LCD screen, how to incorporate a fruit and vegetable motif into their design, and how to hide lesser used buttons.
