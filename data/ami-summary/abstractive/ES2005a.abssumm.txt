The group discussed their initial ideas about the features that they wanted to integrate into the design. They discussed making a universal remote with a locator function. They also discussed the shape and the number of functions in the main interface. The Project Manager instructed the Marketing Expert to examine competitors' remotes, the User Interface Designer to research possible shapes and colors, and the Industrial Designer to research possible materials and the necessary internal components of the device.
