The Project Manager reviewed new requirements for the project with the group and discussed their implementation. The Industrial Designer presented the basic components of a remote control device and how they work together. He showed that the size of the chip they will use is dependent on how many complicated functions are included. The User Interface Designer stressed that the project should focus on a simple design for the device. The group discussed not being able to include a teletext component, and that the product design would have to be the main selling point of the device. The Marketing Expert discussed his marketing strategy for the project, again stressing the attractiveness of the product design. The Industrial Designer proposed including a battery charging stand with the device but it was decided that it was not a useful feature. The group continued to discuss the marketing strategy for the device as it would not include many advanced technological functions; they discussed including a guarantee for the remote and using a unique form factor.
