The Marketing Expert presented requirements of users as found in a company market study. The study showed that users want a fancier-looking but uncomplicated remote control, and are interested in speech recognition. He presented the age groups polled and said that the target marketing group should be users aged fifteen to thirty-five. The User Interface Designer presented several competitors' remotes and discussed the features that would make their own device more user-friendly. The Industrial Designer gave a presentation on important internal components that would keep the project within its budget, and discussed possible materials and programmable features. The Project Manager gave several new requirements for the project to the group. The group discussed the features they would like to incorporate into the design in light of the new requirements and budget constraints. They decided to keep speech recognition as one of their components, and decided to include some programmable features, limit the number of button functions, and make the remote yellow and glow-in-the-dark, in an organic shape. The Program Manager said that he would ask to what extent the company motto had to be incorporated into the design.
