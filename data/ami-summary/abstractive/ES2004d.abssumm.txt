The Project Manager went over decisions from the previous meeting. The Industrial Designer presented the prototype and discussed its look, its internal components, and its interface. The Marketing Expert evaluated the product according to the initial product goals. The group then decided that enough of this criteria had been satisfied for the project to continue. The Project Manager presented the final cost of the device which exceeded the initial projected price point. The group decided to remove speech recognition but to propose to the management that it  remain in the design. The group then discussed their effectiveness as a team. All members felt that they interacted well and that they felt they could be creative. The Marketing Expert felt that the market-research based approach would help the project's success with consumers. The group did express, however, that the budget was overly constraining. The Project Manager instructed the group to fill out a final evaluation questionnaire.
