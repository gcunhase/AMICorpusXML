The project manager opens the meeting by welcoming everybody and saying they will be developing a new television remote control. Then each group member states his/her name and role in the group. The project manager states that the remote needs to be original, trendy, and user-friendly. The further work will be on the functional, conceptual, and detailed design. Since they all know what a whiteboard is, they do a virtual drawing by each stating their favorite animal. The project manager tells them the project budget. They proceed to discuss problems with current remotes as well as preferable styles and looks, such as using face-plates so the look is changable. The project manager closes the meeting.
