The marketing expert discussed user preferences in terms of remote controls and the increasing interest among younger consumers in speech recognition. The marketing expert also discussed a user target group for the remote and addressed the issue of whether the target group would result in sufficient sales of the remote. The user interface designer presented two existing remote controls on the market, which the team later evaluated, and discussed what features in terms of appearance and functionality the remote the team is creating should include. The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and addressed the issue of what happens when remotes no longer operate. The team also discussed options for energy sources, such as solar power and rechargeable internal batteries. Th team then discussed their user target group, marketing ideas such as selling the remote to television manufacturers, and what functions the remote would feature.
