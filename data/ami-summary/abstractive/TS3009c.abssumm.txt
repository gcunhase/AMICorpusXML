For the conceptual design, the marketing expert talked about the public's preference for looks and texture over technological innovation; however, they both seem to be more important than ease of use. The current fashion among younger people favours bright colours and fruit and vegetable themes: pertinent exchangeable fronts can express such trends on the remote. Materials also need to be strong: the marketing expert suggested an iron-plate or titanium front. The industrial designer suggested they use rubber push buttons (and no scroll wheel), simple battery (instead of solar cells or kinetic dynamo), and advanced chip. Speech recognition can be implemented, but it does not link speech commands to remote control actions. He also advised that the users within the target group prefer primary colours, soft textures and curved shapes. The team drew a provisional prototype. They placed the LCD below the buttons. If it is implemented, a recording button, microphone and speaker need to be included in the design. Finally, they decided to have a titanium case with plastic front and the company logo and slogan engraved. Packages with a variety of changeable fronts will be launched.
