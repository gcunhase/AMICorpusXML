The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented their prototypes to the group. Two prototypes featured different fruit shapes, with one including speech recognition instead of a large number of buttons. It also featured scroll wheels for channel control. The other prototype was designed like a banana with children users in mind. The Project Manager announced to the group that with all of their desired features, the project would go over the alotted budget; after a reanalysis of the features of the prototype, the project came in under the budget instead. It was decided that another feature could possibly be added. The group evaluated their effectiveness as a team and felt that all members worked well together and could be creative, and that the project had very good leadership. The Marketing Expert led an evaluation of the prototype according to the initial project goals; the evaluation showed that most of the goals had been sufficiently satisfied in order to launch the product.
