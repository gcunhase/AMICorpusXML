When the meeting begins the project manager lists the agenda and then describes the project, which is to develop a new remote control that is original, trendy, and user-friendly. The group practices using the smart board by choosing an animal to draw and then explaining why they picked it. The project manager goes over the product budget and they proceed to have discussion. They each identify their individual tasks during each phase based on their role in the group. They briefly discuss characteristics of a desirable remote, including medium size buttons, small unit, and work within a good zapping range. The team again discusses their individual responsibilities and move on to ponder whether the remote will be multifunctional or only for the TV. They decide to first assume it is only for TV and video, but allowing the possibility to add more features. They close the meeting upon establishing what each person will do.
