The UI and ID presented a prototype drawing of the remote control design. It can be used as a normal remote, but the speech recognition also provides a more advanced alternative interface. The speech recognition works as a finding mechanism as well. The rubber case is yellow with grey or black, with buttons either made of plastic or rubber. An extra button could activate/deactivate the voice recognition. The prototype proved extremely over budget. The main contributing factors were the solar cell and speech recognition. One way to compensate for the loss of features, but still attract their target group, would be to add more colour to the design. After the costing, the original prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad). The criteria used were fancifulness (2), technological innovation (2), ease of use (2.5), whether it is easy to find (1), sponginess (1.5), number of features (1). Finally, the team evaluated the project process in terms of creativity (choices too narrow), leadership and teamwork (happy with it, but they missed communicating in between meetings), and means (SMARTboard was not satisfactory, but the digital pens were alright, but not too useful). The delay in providing costs of components was criticised.
