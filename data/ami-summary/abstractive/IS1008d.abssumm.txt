The User Interface Designer presented the prototype of the product to the group. The product featured an LCD display, a flip panel, and a customizable case back. The Project Manager displayed the cost of all of the components, and the group decided that the current budget would not allow the addition of the LCD display. The Project Manager decided to negotiate the cost of production to allow the addition of the display. The Marketing Expert gave a presentation on sales projection and showed that the current projected sales point would probably not allow the project to reach its profit aim. The group also discussed the distribution and promotion of the product on the internet. The User Interface Designer expressed concern that there would not be time under the current plan to make changes to the product resulting from consumer testing; the Project Manager decided that no additional changes would be made. The group then discussed other means of promoting the product: launching the remote at the same time as a large sporting event or DVD release.
