Hello. Yeah. That's the kind of spam that everybody likes to receive. Hmm. Do you have any preference uh of order? I think she is still finishing her. Hmm. Okay, it's uh Is it like a crank thing or something. Well, there's sometimes combinations, I mean, like calculators do combinations of battery with but also using some solar power. Uh I think, it has to be on the on the solar energy, but I don't know. Let's have a squeezable remote. If it's rubber, isn't it malleable anyway, it doesn't matter if it's double I mean isn't a rubber case, mean it's completely flexed, I mean, it it flexes to whatever they want it to? Mean so what's the difference between a normal rubber case and a rubble doub double rubber double curved case? Okay. Okay. Go rubber. Go rubber the whole way. I think push-buttons is Yeah. Th the the speech recognition um option is it doesn't seem really very promising for us uh, 'cause uh The yeah the example that they're already using it for is with the coffee machine, where, basically, you can program a sample wi um That when you say something it will give a response, and you program the response as well. Just uh clips of tha that you record yourself. So you can program your coffee-maker that when you say, good morning, to it it says, hello Rick, or whatever. But, I mean, it's not it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the T_V_ on like, turn the T_V_ on, and i turns comes on, but it's not that. It just gives you a it just gives you a verbal response. So, yeah, I mean, like what's the point of saying, Hello remote, I mean, hello, how how are you? Yeah, if you're really lonely, it is it's No, tha that w that w that would be more promising. It it's just a remote that talks to you. Uh. I mean to certain cues. 'Kay. Yeah, I'm fine with the basic battery. Hmm. Yeah, so we want it rub rubber double curved. So rubber rubber keys, yeah. Yeah.. Yeah. We're giving them a way to burn off steam, basically, yeah. Not that watching T_V_ should be that stressful. Oh yeah, I guess T_V_ can be stressful, yeah, if you're watching sports. Alright. Alright. Yeah, some of what I have to say ties into what Catherine was just talking about. Okay, so I'm continuing with the user interface uh topic. And so basically I consulted with our manufacturing division. It sounded like Catherine was also speaking with them. Uh I also took uh Reissa's marketing findings from the last meeting into consideration um, 'cause I think that's that's crucial as far as uh what keys we're going to inc inclu what buttons we are going to include and and how they're laid out. Uh and so the manufacturing division uh sent some some samples of of uh interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products, uh like the coffee machine. So I already mentioned the speech recognition interface. I guess, we we basically vetoed that idea. It's it's pointless. Uh it's just a sample sensor sample output. It would just be probably the most expensive part of our remote without any actual interesting functionality as far as operating the T_V_. Uh so yeah, they they also give the uh they they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an M_P_ three player like iPod. Um so we've already addressed that and I think that would actually be worse for something like R_S_I_ I mean you got that thumb movement that you're constantly doing. Um the other suggestion, and I I have a feeling that we're interested in in something more general, but they suggested uh, you know, going i a little bit into a a niche, like either gearing our remote towards kids, where you could have lot of colours um, the keys might be you know, funny or or, or uh something for the elderly, where the remote's very large and the buttons are very large and there's only a few buttons. But you know we can we can discuss this, but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general, but done well. Uh um So, the key layout and design are really crucial. You don't want uh you want people to be able to quickly access the buttons that they use a lot without uh always pressing the wrong one um. And I didn't mention that we need a power button in our last I can give you an example here of uh, good layout and bad layout uh from our manufacturing department. So this would be an example of bad layout, where you have volume up and volume down, but they have a V_ on both of them, so uh it's sort of confusing for the user. Uh this is the example of the giant remote that's impossible to lose. And for something for kids. Yeah. Um. And so, yeah, I th I think my personal preferences of we've all kind of talked about and seemed to be on the same page um. Uh so I was against the speech recognition and against going uh towards anything in in a niche sense. I think it should be more general. I didn't I didn't think the spinning-wheel or the uh L_C_ display were were crucial for us. And, yeah, that's it for me. So we're we're not gonna have any sort of display I think uh. So, yeah, it's just gonna be just gonna be push-buttons. Um. I think we shall have a limited number of buttons, ideally, I mean a a power, channel up, channel down, volume up, volume down, and a numerical keypad. Uh. And some sort of it will either have a a lock button like we mentioned or or a cover or something like that. I guess it's to the point where we need to decide about that. Well now that we've decided on our Um it seems like we wouldn't wanna make it too busy and too sort of gaudy, but um Yeah, I would say mayb maybe a couple of colours like uh like a black with with yellow and somewhere, like maybe the R_R_ can be yellow, or something like that. I I guess the fact uh also that we are having a rubber case uh would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before. I mean, 'cause uh s so if we wanna have a lock of some sort it would have to be a button. But I think that should be I mean um, I can speak with the button department, but uh I think that it should be easy to have a button that just prevents prevents the other uh the other buttons from operating. So that should be simple. Mm. Yeah. Well it should be it should be maybe cutting edge in some sense, I mean have something that's little more technologically advanced than what's on the market. Yeah. Yeah. Actually, I mean, these first two points we've already sort of gone away from, 'cause our rubber one is not fancy I mean it's different, but I wouldn't say like a rubber remote is fancy. If that's what people want then we maybe we're going in the wrong direction. And it's it's not technologically innovative either. Mm. So is is the advantage of Bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other electronics? Yeah, that's basically what it allows you to do, right? Yeah, the that wouldn't be the remote so much, I mean Mm. Yes, so can Yeah, we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the be the generating like the energy generator. we're all about that. Okay, so we could have keys that are like a b like a broccoli key and a uh and an avocado key on them.. Yeah, that's great for us. Right. Yeah. Yeah, that's great. Yeah, I don't know how we incorporate We don't have to follow every trend, I guess. Uh-huh. The power button could be like a big apple or something. They don they don't own all images of apples. Okay, we'll make it a uh pomegranate, a big pomegranate.. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Sure. The one thing I'm wondering about, I hope that we're not going like too much down a gimmicky road of of having I mean if somebody go goes into the store they're gonna see like three or four normal remotes, and then a big spongy pink t tomato uh remote. I mean what are ninety per cent of people gonna take? Mm. Yeah I mean, that that seems to work well with for products like iPod, where, you know, you have a variety of colours, that people feel like they're customising it when they buy it, even, you know, just just by the fact of choosing. Right. Yeah. Okay. Oh right. Yeah. That sounds good. Mm. Right. Alright. Yeah. Yeah. Mm, I think we all know what we need to do now. Okay. Okay, I'll stay in here. Does the pay-raise immediately come into effect on our next pay-check, or is that So we're buying fut I mean, we're getting futures in the company. So we really have a incentive to make this remote work. I'd like to share in the coffee machine profits, because that's really doing well. Yeah.. This company has its its fingers in a lot of different pots. Yeah, we're definitely not in the money making department. Well I I did notice looking at I mean, they told you that they wanted whatev our product to represent the the R_R_ brand and and to be immediately noticeable. I mean, if you look like at the coffee maker at the at the corporate web page, it's not obvious. R_R_. Well it is to us, because we we worked worked here for years and we use that coffee machine, but it's doesn't have the colour scheme of of the of the company anywhere on it obviously it's just sil silver and black. No. Mm. Okay. Right, well, I guess that's us. Okay. Right.
Oh right okay. I cover myself up.. I've always wanted one of these, I really have. Where do you buy 'em from? They're. Yeah. Oh my gosh. Mm-hmm. Batteries. It's here. Ah. Mm. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Mm. I think rubber's But after my after my fashion thing, I think you'll realise that rubber is more People. What about the just developed uh sample sensor? G there, the sample sensor, sample speaker thing. Mm, I dunno. Be cool. Channel two. Oh, it just gives an answer. Oh, then then I thought I thought it was when they said I thought when they said, voice recognition, they meant um like, channel five, and it will change. Like you talk to it. Can I have channel five? Oh, then forget about it. Oh right okay. Mm. Mm. Yeah. So it will look like something like this.. Yeah. Well the rubber push-buttons. Don't you have to move your Mm. Mm. Yeah, the rubber's good. Yeah, so they can sit there and go like Mm. Mm. That does get annoying. Uh-huh. Well Maybe we can Right. Well, I'm just basically letting you know what's happening in the markets and what the fashions are for next year. Um. So yes, so from looking at this year's trends and fashions and also recent investigation that we've done in the remote control market, we have found that for the remote control market these are like most important aspects like that we really need to which we've already probably discussed. Um the most important aspect is look and feel. So the remote control has to look and feel fancier than the ones that already that we already have. So it has to be Yep. Exactly. Um second, uh it should be technologically innovative innovative. So Technologically it should be like um work, basically, I guess. It should work. Should That's new. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. So, no loose That's why I was thinking, Bluetooth, 'cause if you like put up Bluetooth, and it's like a Bluetooth remote control, everybody's gonna like, oh, 'cause Bluetooth is the in thing nowadays, like it really is, like people and um when it comes to marketing like that's what people go for, they don't really care whether, you know, at the end of the day whether it works properly or not. Well, they do, but it's like it's not Yeah, but it looks good. If it looks good and it's it can just be there for decoration. But like You could always insert, yeah. Yeah, but, I mean, people like Well, if you're looking at if you looking at something that's going to be bought by people, you have to make it new, you have to make it state of the art. Well, it doesn't Like it doesn't have to be, you know, Bluetooth, that was just an idea, but like it needs do something that, you know, is new. Whether it's a battery it could be something really really minor, you know, like but I think we are really keeping to what is already out there, and people've already seen it, people've already got it. If we want something new, we need to move away from what we already have and um just go creative. And then you can market it. Never have to change a battery again. I think, safety s Yeah. Third most important aspect uh is it's easy to use. And I think we've all um worked that out. Um okay, in the fashion, how it's supposed to look. Next year's fashion i very much in fruit and vegetables are thm are like the theme for cloths, shoes and furniture. So next year people will be buying, I found this really funny, you know, strawberry shaped chairs, and things. Yeah. Rubber things. Um and as it's rubber the feel which is in this year is spongy, so it's it's not quite spongy, but spongy, I would say is yeah, so we're in. Yeah. And so personal what I was just saying like move away from the current remote controls uh like the look and the feel of the current ones and change the look and feel, while still keeping to the company's image, basically. So yeah.. I had to say So we're moving in the right direction like Mm. Maybe make it like fruity colours or something. Some sort. Or Mm. Well I think, if it's rubber it needs to be different. I think, it's it should be I mean, what do you associate with rubber? You know like really different colours basically. Okay, sor I sorry, I used the wrong word, what do you associate with the mate the material that material? Um Um like I'm just thinking bright colours. Bright natural colours, nothing too Bright, but too not yeah. Like no lime green or bright yellow or bright pink. Wanna make it different colours so anybody can choo like like Yeah. And on the back of it have the logo. Well I can say in this country, you'll get, you know, lots of people wanting something really funky and cool. Like and kids will be walking in with their parents saying, Mummy I wanna buy that one. And uh parents will see the will see the pro as well, because it's um like kids won't break it, it's not breakable if you throw it around. Especially with younger kids, you know they can pick it up and and Yeah. The only thing is is that really small kids might chew on it, but Yeah. So so it's rea it's quite it's quite like um user friendly and also for different families, like like family use as well, so for little kids and for old ki like teenagers will like it, I think. Especially maybe younger girls if it's in pink they'll be like pink remote control for their room something. Yeah. So like you walk in, you're like, oh I like that remote control, because it's so bright, and then, and then the shop assistant comes up and says, oh what colour would you like? and then they go like, oh I can choose the colour wow. So it puts, I think, even the customer into more control over what they're buying instead of, you've got all colour it's either that or nothing. So they also get to pick. Well, personally I like walking into a shop and choosing a colour. It's um Yeah. Mm. D you've got the Evaluation. Mm. Yeah. S This gives you all the details? um. Yeah. Mm. Mm.
. Almost. Mm 'kay. No no no no, it's fine I'm just preparing. Okay. Where is that thing? Oh sorry, couldn't see. Would that work? Okay, so that's me again. Um so um for the energy sources we can have a basic battery, a hand dynamo which is which was used uh in the fifties for torches, if you remember that kind of which wouldn't be v wouldn't be v v yeah, yeah. It wouldn't be very fancy. You can have a kinetic provision of energy, which is used on some watches these days. So if you have just a bit of gentle movement that it will give it the energy to work. Or you can use solar cells, but I'm not sure about that indoors, really, but Yeah. I dunno actually. I dunno. Um. Think the the uh what would cost the less would be the basic battery, really. And uh if we want something fancier, I think the kinetic provision of energy could be nice, but I don't know if it's worth the cost. So we've got to discuss that. For the case of the remotes itself, um they can be a general case, which is just a flat one. You can have uh a curved one or a double curved one, if you know what I mean, so You know, kind of more ergonomic, that kind of suits the palm of your hand, that kind of thing. So Um then the case material itself, so it can be uh uh either plastic or latex, uh rubber, wood, or titanium. And th for each of them you have uh cases where for example titanium, you can't use it for if you if we're choosing a double curved case, we can't choose titanium. And if we are choosing um solar cells then we can't choose latex for the case material, so we just have to take that into account. But if we're choosing just the flat case then we can go for anything. And I think we discussed earlier on the R_ S_ I_ problem thing, so we could uh Yeah. Yeah. And also it doesn't break as easily maybe, I dunno So rubber would be Okay. Uh s so if d okay. And then there are the push-buttons, so you can have basic push-buttons or a scroll-wheels, like you have on a mouse, um or you could have um L_C_D_, which gives you a display. Um scroll buttons, as well. So if you use a rubber double curved case, you must use rubber push-buttons. So if we're going for rubber then we have to decide for the case. Um and if we choose double curved then we have to go for rubber push-buttons. So it's a constraint. Yeah, but is it a double curved one or not? If it's not a double curved, then we've got the choice for the push-buttons, if it's a double curve, we've gotta go for rubber push-buttons. If that makes sense. Yeah.. No, but na le you see, you've got, okay, the energy that's one thing, then you have the case is uh, whether it's flat or curved. And that's we don't care if it's rub rubber or not, but then we've decided that we going for rubber for the case material. So if we've chosen rub rubber and if now we have the choice for the case whether it's flat, single curved or double curved. And I'm just saying if it if we choose it to be double curved then we need to go I dunno why, but we need to go for uh rubber push-buttons. So, either I dunno we just need to decide on the on the case. Let's go crazy. And then, do I have a last slide? Yes, I do. Um so the push-buttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be so that's just the electronics between the but behind the push-buttons. Um and the price that go with it with it, so the simple push-buttons are gonna be the cheapest. Uh if we get a scroll-wheel, that's a higher price range. If we get an advanced chip which is um used for the L_C_D_, the display thing, then that's even more expensive. Mm.. Yeah. The infra-red. Yeah. Well, if if it's not chip on print then, I guess, you get different chip components, and you build them separately and doesn't include the infra-red. It's less expensive mm Technically speaking, it's not as advanced, but it does the job, too. Fo It doesn't, yeah, yeah, yeah. Totally. Yeah. So let's not go for the Yeah, yeah. I agree. So it's either um the scroll-wheel or the push-buttons. Well It'd be it'd be cool, but they are saying they've just developed it, I'm just guessing. But it's gonna be the most expensive option, probably and Hm. Just if you are really lonely, maybe. Channel five. And then it switches on. Okay, so I'll go back, maybe, to the previous slide and we can decide for each problem, what we should choose. So for the energy source, do we go for the battery or the Cheaper option. Are you happy with that? Okay. So we'll go for the battery. Then the case, do you want it flat or curved or sing or double curved? Double? Okay, so then if we use double curved case, then we have to u choose rubber push-buttons, and that's fine? P Yeah. I thought they would give an option of flat buttons or a That they don't. Mm. Alright, that's me done. Sorry. Well Bluetooth would, for example, enable you, I think, to um um connect for example you if you get a w call on your mobile phone, but your mobile phone is downstairs or something, you would get on your television you're being called by this person right now. Things like that. No i No, but if you get Bluetooth on the remote, you'd be able to I with the television, yeah. I was just trying to find an advantage. Wha what w what advantage would you get for the Maybe the kinetic mo provision of energy then. It's been done for watches, but I haven't seen that for remotes, yet. Change the batteries ever again. Yeah, well, and in little characters you say, yeah, but not too much. Yep. No vegetables. Well yeah, but Apple would sue you for that. sued the Beatles so Yeah. Why not? I'm gonna write that down. That's yeah. Although I'd be curious to see how many uh You know, there are some colours that I wouldn I would never choose, and I would be curious how many people choose that colour. Mm. And produce less of the silly colours, maybe. Yep. Alright. Mm. Cool. It is. Great. That's true. Doesn't Yeah. Are we taking these off?
I feel like Madonna with one of these on. I said I feel like Madonna with one of these on. Right. Hello everybody. Back again for another wonderful meeting. Is uh everyone ready? Okay, we c we can hold on for a minute. I figured with the spam thing, if you can't beat it, join in. Are you ready? Okay, right, well, I take it that you are all ready now. Um alright first off we'll just uh recap from our last meeting. Um which was we got together just to basically decide on well to talk about what it is that we were actually uh supposed to be doing, and who we all are and stuff like that, mm get bit more of an idea together of what's going on. Um what we are gonna talk about in this meeting is um now that we know what it is that we are doing, now we know that it's a T_V_ remote and stuff and you guys have just been off doing some some uh R_ and D_ for that, that's research and development for those that haven't heard that before, see I'm learning all sorts of new technologi terms in technology today. Um yeah, we're gonna hear your uh th three little presentations, whether they be on computer or on the whiteboard or whatever you want. Um I'd like to um hear o I'd like to hear who's g who's on the um from from uh Catherine actually first. I want what I'd like to hear about is uh if we've finally decided on um what sort of energy we're gonna be using and It's just that yeah, let's let's hear from you first. Get yourself in position. I don't think any of us remember the fifties. Do sol solar panel things, do they have to work from the sun or can they work from a light bulb? Does anybody know? Okay. Mm. Okay, jolly good. What's a double curved one? Okay. So that might be an idea of using the rubber, but then it should, you know yeah. when a T_V_ programme's got one watching the match and your team's just lost, you can fuzz it across the room and it'll bounce off the wall back at you. Yeah, I like that idea. Rubber, we're all we're all going we're all liking that idea? You think you can market that? Ooh, we like rubber, ooh. Uh-huh. Well, we're gonna go with I think we've decided that it's gonna be a rubber case so push buttons instead of the wheel? rubble double double. I'll have a Big Mac, please. Let's have rubber push buttons, hey. Yeah. Simple, yeah. Chip on print. It's a bit. Okay, uh what I'm not understanding here is uh, okay, advanced chip on print, which I presume is like one P_C_B_ and that's got all the electronics on one board including the um infra-red sender? Right. Um what a what alternatives do we have to that? Y um what alternatives do we have to the chip on print? so it sounds So, why would we not go for that? If it's something that's inside the the unit. I it doesn't affects whether the customer's gonna buy it or not. Um we wanna go for an i i all so long as it works, you know. So let's not let's uh not bother with the chip on print. Yeah. S yeah, push buttons. What about what? Well, what do we need a speaker for in a remote control unit? S Yeah. It's not something that we wanna t go into with this product. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Basic battery. It's cheap, it's cheerful, it's worked, does work. We were go we were going with the late with the the R_S_I_ rubber, weren't we? The the The double whopper, please. Yep, but we're going for the simple buttons. Yeah. And it's cheapest all round, it sounds kinda funky, and we can also market it as i 'cause we were s saying earl you were saying earlier in your research that um the the people have the R_ people were getting the complaining about R_S_I_, and this is anti-R_S_I_. So that's another marketing point that we can use. But anything is gonna have buttons. Even if it's a jog wheel, it's still repetitive. You You see, you can still get it does you still get repetitive strain injury, whether you are pressing a button or pressing a flat bit of screen. It's the v it's the fact that you are pressing the same doing the same movement. It's not actually what you are doing. But the fact that this this rubber i is actually used in these anti-R_S_I_ ps specific Yeah. And you know, yeah, you can fuzz it across the room and throw it at throw it at your children yeah. Okay, Gabriel. Let's um let's let's hear from you about the um it's the interface. Great. Mm. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Do we have an uh example of a good one? Brilliant. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Well let's um so w what are our definite decisions on this then as a team? The um The the um the interface type we're going for Just the simple s simple straight set of buttons. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, and we're not yeah. Are we gonna hav hav an are we d have we decided on whether w we're gonna s supplement it with anything, you know, colours or particular gimmicky bits to it, we're not we're just gonna go for something We're Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okey-dokey. Yeah, I don't have any other questions on this. Let's move over to Yeah, sure.. Yeah, the button that just does that, yeah. Cool. Mm yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, why should people buy this when they're already got a remote that came with the T_V_? What's that mean? Okay, now the trouble is is we've already decided that we're going with the stuff that works already, that's cheap. Yeah. Maybe we could um Of course, they do. One hundred per cent, that's your first thing, you go, oh I'm not gonna buy that, 'cause I dunno if it works or not. Okay, well, what do you two think about this? Yeah, what I don't understand what m Yeah, and it this is just gonna all this is being used for is your television. It would that would mean you'd need a television that has Bluetooth in it, which no no television does, does it? That would mean we'd have to make a television as well. No, that would be your telephone in with your television. Yeah, and i Nah, the televi the television would have to be a Bluetooth compatible, basically. An and there is no there is no such thing. Okay. Okay. Yeah, this that's that's very good. And and this is all tying in very nicely. The fact that it's made out of this rubber, we can throw it about. Th we should encourage people to throw their remote controls about, because it charges itself up by doing it. But yeah, by the squeezing it the Yeah, that's a great idea. Well done. Yeah. I wanna watch the pineapple channel. Well spongy, that's where. Yeah, we're we're ahead of the game there. Okay. Alright, yeah, no, this i this is good, so through all that we've we go we're right, we're gonna go go back to um going with the kinetic thing, that's great, using the spongy rubber that we were talking about that anti-R_S_I_ you can as you squeeze it you are not only therapeuticising yourself, you are charging the batteries, and um I'm not sure about the buttons being in the shape of fruit though.. Yeah, this is true. Well, okay, it seems like the only thing that we haven't really finally um agreed on is its image. Like, yeah, we're we're saying no we don't want it to be fruit and vegetables, but we dunno what it should be, or like are we going yeah it looks slick, but what do what do we mean by slick sort of thing? I mean you said earlier on i it should be funky. L keep it clean, keep it clean. Bright, but not too bright. Like the volume buttons should be the all the same colour and the d and the the channel buttons should be one colour and stuff like that, do you mean? Okay, what? Okay. Tha Yeah, I mean we that's we we Yeah. This is the remote control tomato. Yeah. Well, it's it's gotta be chew proof. So, what are you saying, maybe we should market it in different colours for different so we could do like the pink range, the blue range, the green range, the Mm. Well that's that can be down to bit of market researching you know, if that's easy enough to find out what colours are more popular. Mm. Okay. Alright. Well um, we'll alright let's what we're gonna aim to get together by the next meeting then um is from you Catherine wi your y y you know you're gonna be working on the the look and feel design. Um Gabriel, you're gonna be working on, you know come up with the the user interface design. Then basically, you two are gonna be working together on this. You won't be going off to your separate offices. Um and I think you are gonna get a chance to play with some clay. I think, yeah, it's gonna you know, come up ki you know, be ab for the next meeting be able to come in and show us some some i some physical ideas. 'Cause at the moment, uh you know, it's it's hard. We were kinda going, yeah, it's gotta feel nice, it's gotta look cool and that it's you know now we can actually start, you know, s some sort of physical something or other. Um and you're gonna be working on the product evaluation. Um. And I will be uh talking to the bosses, basically, and uh f fielding off some more spam and uh that's it really. Keeping things t well, uh you know, ho hopefully uh keeping things together. Um. Yeah, that's This is this is uh good. So we know for definite we know we've we've now got some definite things going on. We definitely know how it's powered, we definitely know that um it's gonna be a simple buttons, we're not gonna be going for the new technological chip on print expensive things, so we've we're keeping the costs down. It's this rubber casing that we can sell as um fun and funky. Don't know of any other remote controls that are made out of this stuff. People, you know, people are saying, oh, standard stuff gives you repetitive strain injury, well this remote control is designed to do the complete opposite, It's supposed to fix it rather than cause it. Um. you know, we're gonna we we're gonna as a sort of extra something on it, you know what what extra things are there extra things this product have? We'll look into this lock key facility, although whether or not it happens, or is possible, I don't know, but something to look into. Okay. I think that's um well done everybody. Anyone have any uh any questions, everyone know what they're doing? 'Cause if you don't, you'll I'm sure you'll soon get an e-mail about it. Okay. right well. It's um we're we've still couple of minutes until our meeting's due to finish. But um I got a note saying that you two who are gonna be working together so bef before you all disappear off just hold hold fire. Um. Um I think, it's uh, yeah, I think, it's gonna be par part more of a profit sharing on the product. Yeah, I think i I think that's I think that's the way it's gonna happen at the moment. Yeah. Yeah. I want a share in the space rocket. Did you see that this k that this company we've made a spaceship. Yeah. Yeah.. Yeah. Mm. And the spaceship doesn't have the R_ have a massive R_ and R_ down the side of it but I still want one. Okay. Um I've just had a sign flashing up saying, finish the meeting. Uh. Yeah. Yeah. It's not telling it's not saying do anything in particular just yet. So maybe you should go back to your own offices. Yeah. Yeah, it says you two



@highlight

Um alright first off we'll just uh recap from our last meeting .

@highlight

Um which was we got together just to basically decide on well to talk about what it is that we were actually uh supposed to be doing , Um yeah , we're gonna hear your uh th three little presentations , o I'd like to hear who's g who's on the um from from uh Catherine actually first .

@highlight

Um so um for the energy sources we can have a basic battery , a hand dynamo which is which was used uh in the fifties for torches , You can have a kinetic provision of energy , Or you can use solar cells , Well , there's sometimes combinations , I mean , like calculators do combinations of battery with but also using some solar power .

@highlight

but I'm not sure about that indoors , really , but And uh if we want something fancier , I think the kinetic provision of energy could be nice , Think the the uh what would cost the less would be the basic battery , really .

@highlight

For the case of the remotes itself , um they can be a general case , which is just a flat one .

@highlight

You can have uh a curved one or a double curved one , Um then the case material itself , so it can be uh uh either plastic or latex , uh rubber , wood , or titanium .

@highlight

And th for each of them you have uh cases where for example titanium , you can't use it for if you if we're choosing a double curved case , we can't choose titanium .

@highlight

But if we're choosing just the flat case then we can go for anything .

@highlight

So that might be an idea of using the rubber , And also it doesn't break as easily maybe , Rubber , we're all we're all going we're all liking that idea ?

@highlight

so you can have basic push-buttons or a scroll-wheels , like you have on a mouse , um or you could have um L_C_D_ , which gives you a display .

@highlight

Um and if we choose double curved then we have to go for rubber push-buttons .

@highlight

Mean so what's the difference between a normal rubber case and a rubble doub double rubber double curved case ?

@highlight

Let's have rubber push buttons , hey .

@highlight

Um so the push-buttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be If we get an advanced chip which is um used for the L_C_D_ , the display thing , then that's even more expensive .

@highlight

is uh , okay , advanced chip on print , which I presume is like one P_C_B_ and that's got all the electronics on one board including the um infra-red sender ?

@highlight

Well , if if it's not chip on print then , I guess , you get different chip components , and you build them separately and doesn't include the infra-red .

@highlight

If it's something that's inside the the unit .

@highlight

I it doesn't affects whether the customer's gonna buy it or not .

@highlight

So let's not let's uh not bother with the chip on print .

@highlight

What about the just developed uh sample sensor ?

@highlight

Well , what do we need a speaker for in a remote control unit ?

@highlight

I'm just guessing .

@highlight

But it's gonna be the most expensive option , probably and it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the T_V_ on like , turn the T_V_ on , and i turns comes on , a it just gives you a verbal response .

@highlight

Oh , then forget about it .

@highlight

so we want it rub rubber double curved .

@highlight

So rubber rubber keys , yeah .

@highlight

But the fact that this this rubber i is actually used in these anti-R_S_I_ ps specific Okay , so I'm continuing with the user interface uh topic .

@highlight

Uh and so the manufacturing division uh sent some some samples of of uh interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products , uh like the coffee machine .

@highlight

they they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an M_P_ three player like iPod .

@highlight

So I already mentioned the speech recognition interface .

@highlight

I guess , we we basically vetoed that idea .

@highlight

but they suggested uh , you know , going i a little bit into a a niche , but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general , but done well .

@highlight

I can give you an example here of uh , good layout and bad layout So this would be an example of bad layout , where you have volume up and volume down , but they have a V_ on both of them , so uh Uh this is the example of the giant remote that's impossible to lose .

@highlight

Uh so I was against the speech recognition and against going uh towards anything in in a niche sense .

@highlight

I didn't I didn't think the spinning-wheel or the uh L_C_ display were were crucial for us .

@highlight

So we're we're not gonna have any sort of display I think uh .

@highlight

I think we shall have a limited number of buttons , ideally , I mean a a power , channel up , channel down , volume up , volume down , and a numerical keypad .

@highlight

it will either have a a lock button like we mentioned or or a cover or something like that .

@highlight

Um it seems like we wouldn't wanna make it too busy and too sort of gaudy , Yeah , I would say mayb maybe a couple of colours like uh like a black with with yellow and somewhere , I I guess the fact uh also that we are having a rubber case uh would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before .

@highlight

Well , I'm just basically letting you know what's happening in the markets So the remote control has to look and feel fancier than the ones that already that we already have .

@highlight

Um second , uh it should be technologically innovative innovative .

@highlight

now the trouble is is we've already decided that we're going with the stuff that works already , that's cheap .

@highlight

I mean it's different , but I wouldn't say like a rubber remote is fancy .

@highlight

That's why I was thinking , Bluetooth , 'cause Bluetooth is the in thing nowadays , like it really is , they don't really care whether , you know , at the end of the day whether it works properly or not .

@highlight

Of course , they do .

@highlight

So is is the advantage of Bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other that would mean you'd need a television that has Bluetooth in it , which no no television does , Well , if you're looking at if you looking at something that's going to be bought by people , you have to make it new , you have to make it state of the art .

@highlight

Like it doesn't have to be , you know , Bluetooth , If we want something new , we need to move away from what we already have Okay .

@highlight

Yeah , this that's that's very good .

@highlight

Maybe the kinetic mo provision of energy then .

@highlight

It's been done for watches , but I haven't seen that for remotes , yet .

@highlight

Yeah , we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the be the generating like the energy generator .

@highlight

Next year's fashion i very much in fruit and vegetables are thm are like the theme for cloths , shoes and furniture .

@highlight

Okay , so we could have keys that are like a b like a broccoli key and a uh and an avocado key on them .

@highlight

right , we're gonna go go back to um going with the kinetic thing , and as it's rubber the feel which is in this year is spongy , Yeah , we're we're ahead of the game there .

@highlight

and um I'm not sure about the buttons being in the shape of fruit though .

@highlight

Maybe make it like fruity colours or something .

@highlight

The power button could be like a big apple or something .

@highlight

Um like I'm just thinking bright colours .

@highlight

Wanna make it different colours so anybody can choo like like so we could do like the pink range , the blue range , the green range , the where , you know , you have a variety of colours , that people feel like they're customising it when they buy it , even , you know , just just by the fact of choosing .

@highlight

from you Catherine wi your y y you know you're gonna be working on the the look and feel design .

@highlight

Um Gabriel , you're gonna be working on , you know come up with the the user interface design .

@highlight

Then basically , you two are gonna be working together on this .

@highlight

come up ki you know , be ab for the next meeting be able to come in and show us some some i some physical ideas .

@highlight

Um and I think you are gonna get a chance to play with some clay .

@highlight

Um and you're gonna be working on the product evaluation .

@highlight

We'll look into this lock key
