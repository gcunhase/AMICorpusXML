Is that for us? Okay. Yeah, shall I show? I'll show. Though do you do you wanna do you wanna sh do you wanna hold it and I'll I'll show you the presentation. Can I just nick your Whoa. Going a bit crazy over here. Thank you. Okay, so this is our look and feel presentation, the final our final presentation. And we'll first look at the exterior of what we've uh come up with over there. Um It's gonna have a a plastic body um with a sort of standard colour, either we're thinking some something fairly neutral like a a white or a light blue or something. This is underneath the rubberised the rubberised uh outer casing um which there'd be sort of a wide choice they would be attached, but we can we can come up with that. Um the um wide choice of colours and sort of patterns, so you've got you've got a lot of customisation with it. Um it's obviously an a sort of clam-shell design and uh the um the top L_C_D_ screen that you can see that would b would be sort of um how do you say, it's yeah yeah, it would be sort of inset into the into the top and the buttons at the bottom would d so so it'll fully close flat. Yeah, yeah. And working on the inside we've um already said d decided on the kinetic batteries, which actually, thinking about it now, could y could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well, so that you could probably get a bit of Yeah. Yeah. Um we decided that um the voice recognition system, it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in and they were fairly easy to get a-hold of, so we presumed that they'd also be quite cheap. So you'd have something like where you'd shout out, where where is the remote and it'll shout back, I'm here, or something. And then yeah. It wo it won't shout out I'm here or something. It'll just shout out I'm here, or something to similar effect. Uh yeah, if it was going like I d well tha that could be something for next time, maybe. You can have a remote that tells you exactly where it is. Um the standard, there's be a standard transmission with the T_V_ using using all the standard chips that we've talked about. Um it would it would have obviously 'cause it's split over two two different layers, it would need two separate P_C_B_s, so it would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling. And uh because, obviously, all T_V_s use this, the same infrared medium, we'd just be using using the same thing to transmit the data. And the infrared um sender would be on the on one of the bot the bottom layer, just at the front of the we haven't I don't think we actually put it on. Yeah, yeah, something like that. Yeah, on the front on the front side of that, yeah. So when you've actually got it open, it would be facing the T_V_. And then finally um on to the interface. The top screen, as we said, is would be an inset um black and white L_C_D_ s touch screen which yeah would uh have all of all of the the available functions for for the remote on it, uh whereas the bot the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons, like the vo volume up and down, channel up and down, power on and off, and uh things to that effect. And now we've we also decided on the inside, we could possibly either have um some some kind of sort of bezzled uh logo on it, or something inset, or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top. No d not not actually. No, not uh interfering with l the whole look of the the product when it's uh on the thing. And finally that's how we put the fashion back into electronics, as that is that's the company logo. There you go.. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Yeah, I'd uh yeah I'd probably put it uh two yeah, two or three. No, three. Three. Mm yeah. Yeah, yeah. I'd give it a one. No, no, not at all. Yeah. Two. Two. Yeah. D_. One. Yeah. Yeah, that's No, no, the the base colour was um white or or like or l sort of a light blue, but the changeable fa faces would uh allow you to get any basically any one of a number of colours that uh th it's full sort of customised. Yeah, yeah, yeah and No, no, 'cause th that's that's the the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put round it, that otherwise it's just sort of hard plastic. Yeah, I'll give it a one as well. Yeah. Mm. No. Yeah. It's meant to be. Yeah. Yeah, I'd uh I'd f I'd go for a five, actually, 'cause Yep. Yeah. Yeah, it was it was uh a voice voice recognition, yeah. Yeah, yeah, that yeah, that's feasible. Um I think it would r I think it would probably be a a stand it would be a stand it would be quite loud. So it would be s p yeah. Yeah. Yeah, one. I do realise that we might be being fairly biased, 'cause it is our product, but W I thin yeah, I think yeah. Mm. No. Yeah. It was a regular chip on print and Oh, no, no, no, the um Yeah, it's you you've put in three for the number of kinetic cells, there should just be one. In the top, it's the number of c yeah. Yeah, and yeah, just a no, one reg v uh Yeah, one of them and one sample sensor and sample speaker. And they're double curved. No. Y Two, 'cause it's two. Yeah, I'd say I'd say it was w yeah, I think I think it's One double-curved. And one no, 'cause one yeah, one's double-curved, and then the other one's a plastic. Yeah. And special colour. Yeah. Yeah. No, no, that's it's as an extra. So that shouldn't that shouldn't be actually on there, because that's not incorporated in the cost of the remote you get. Yeah, okay. Yeah, the push-button's one and L_C_ display one. And buttons Well yes. Yeah. No, we'll have No, no, you've got to click off to calculate it again. C it might uh you might you might be assuming that that is in Euros. It could be in Dollars. And then it would be fine, because the exchange range would make it about twelve. No. Yeah, the standard, it um it would make one difference. The biggest one would be taking away if you took away If you to Yeah. If if you take away the voice, I I do I don't like to say it, but if you take away the voice recognition, then you've got it. Yeah i yeah. No 'cause it's samples sens sample speaker. If you took away that, that'll make it twelve point three five. They n n yeah, but you p minus three plus two. Yeah. But they but I mean in I don't see why we have to sell it for twenty five Euros now, because they w they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product. Yeah. We c we could s Yeah, we could say Yeah, I s And then say we recommend Yeah. Yeah. That'll do it. Twelve point three five. Is it twelve point fif was it twelve point fifty? Ah. Okay. Yeah. No. 'Cause that that was just a bought-on extra, you could just take that out and that would be fine, yeah. Yeah, I think that's brilliant. Yeah. Yes. Yeah, I'd say, as a team. Yeah. Find out from each other, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, no, I thought it it went really well and I yeah, I I feel that everyone was listened to and all the points that were raised seem to have been sorted out, although we didn't quite make the voice recognition in there, but that's that's good. I think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually if if if we'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out, I think maybe it would've come out a d little different, but yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah, well. Discuss which ones yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I think I think we probably woulda used the outer email system more, had we actually had had more time and if we'd been separated more. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Vegetables. Yeah. No. Yeah, I do I don't think the the companies are really concerned. They're just like we've got a D_V_D_ player, does anyone remember the remote control? Can't you get the one that we used for the last one? Yeah, just jazz it up a bit. Uh d they don't really think about it, because normally, the remote control isn't the product which they're trying to ship. They're trying to ship the D_V_D_ player, the video player, the T_V_. Yeah. Yeah. No. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Well. I think that was just the the physical. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I think yeah I don't from the market research. No. Yeah, it was I it's top secret. Um it's it is it's a conspiracy going on here. That's what it is. In your yeah. Okay. Is that it then? Awesome. Was that not the questionnaire for the how you felt you'd done in your thing? I don't think. Yeah, the the s yeah. I think yeah, questionnaire seven was the one I did just before the meeting. Mm.
Is that someone's? Okay. Or something. Well done. Certainly. Logged in? Thank you. Oops. Okay. This stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research. So this is the first stage of the evaluation. Now, the collection of the criteria, as we saw in our previous meeting, was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company. So it's what we've discussed in the last meeting, are we actually meeting those trends and requirements? Now the findings that we came up with, just a recap, are here. The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel, technological innovation, it should be easy to use, it should incorporate current fashion trends, and those the two main ones, they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours. The design should minimise R_S_I_ and be easy to locate and we were still um uh slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there, though that did seem to be the favoured strategy, but there was also, on the sideline, the though of maybe having a beeper function. Okay, so we can come back to that slide, if you don't have a note of those. I'll just show you how we're going to evaluate our own feedback to this, to what we have so far. We're going to use a seven point scale, where one is true and seven is false. We look at each of those criteria that I've just mentioned, I'll call that slide back up, and I will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here. Does that seem clear? Any questions there? So we're going to look at these crite Yes, we're going to come to w we'll discuss each one and we'll come to a consensus rating between one and seven. Is that okay? One is true, seven is false. Right. So I won't write all of that out again. It will just be criteria one, two, three, four, five, six, or A_, B_, C_, D_, E_, F_ to confuse it with the number rating. B_, C_, D_, E_, F_. This is where I realise how tiny I actually am. Criteria and rating. Actually, it might be an idea, if we each did give our own individual rating, and we could take an average at the end. How about that? Okay. So I'll just separate the ratings by obliques, and if we go one, two, three, four, we know who's who. Okay. Criteria A_, the fancy look and feel. How do we feel about this prototype model relating to fancy it is a fancy look and feel. One is true, seven is false. My own rating for that would be a two. One is true and seven is false. I'll just go this way. Two. Okay. Two. A four, okay. Adding those up, we've got a six and a five, eleven divided by four is what? Uh two and three quarters, it that right. Two and three quarters? Okay. Two point seven five, there we go. Okay, criteria B_, criterion B_, technologically innovative. I would give that a three. Okay. Not that you're biased in that it the designer. The average oh, for you? You want your rating to be a two? Is that what you're saying? Okay. So, I'll work out the average for that again at the end. It's a very slightly altered Okay, and we're just waiting for your rating f Two point five, okay. Losing one decimal place, that's okay. So what are you rating for this one, Paw? Two, okay. So that is eight. That brings it down to two, nice and simple, yeah. Okay, ease of use. Easy to use? Based on what you've said there, I would say a one, true. Two. A two, okay. Two. I should've said a two to make the arithmetic easy, shouldn't I? We'll just put almost two, because I'm not gonna get into silly decimal places. Okay. Or we or if we want to really bring it down, we can do later. Um mm now we're looking at it incorporates current fashion trends, now that's particularly in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colours. Right. So I'm just thinking, before I give it my rating, you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here. Is this actually going to be the colours that you would use? Right. So we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and that's what we're intending to do. Okay. And the spongy feel is no problem with that. Okay. In that case it's got to be a one for me. Yep. Everybody? Okay. That part was nice and easy. Okay. Uh moving on to does the design minimise repetitive strain injury. I don't think we've really touched on that a lot. We've we've discussed it, we haven't really come up with anything that we felt could feasibly reduce that. We've talked about pointers, but the very use of a remote control, if you're someone who's zapping, who's sitting like that, and we found so many people did, how do you minimise that on such a small device? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Right. Right. I think I'm gonna have to be neutral on that and give it a four. A five, okay. Four and a four okay. Twenty one is that twenty one? So that's four point two five. And finally, last but not least, easy to locate. Now we talked about voice recognition, we talked about a beeper, have we really have the designers come to any dec real decision on that? It was the I'm here thing, yep. And are we happy with the costs on that? That is going to be feasible, cost-wise. That sounds good then. I'd go for a I ca we can adjust the volume on that, just as we could volume on T_V_. So if sombody's in the other room or if T_V_s in different rooms, or. Right. Okay. You built into the feature. Okay. Logical. That's a one for me. One and one, good. So, how do we feel about this? We've got our our we've got the highest rating of meeting the specifications that is definitely true for two of the uh six criteria there. That is for um incorporates current fashion trends and is easy to locate. The lowest rating we've got, which is really n it's not terribly low, i it's close around neutral is for uh the minimisation of repetitive strain injury. Do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it, or do we have to make further modifications? We happy to go ahead? Yeah. I think for most of those ratings that it's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that, and I really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities, we could actually do much more to minimise that. I know. Okay. Well, I hope that's uh clear to the team. Is there anything you would like to to ask me about the findings before I sum up? Good. Fine then. I'll just leave it there. Oops. Oh yes. Yes. But it has a slightly flattened bottom so it can sit. So it can rest. It would just be a flat bottom with one curve. like a domed thing. Mm. The other curves at the sides, but it's slightly flattened at the bottom so it doesn't roll over. Yeah. What does it mean if you put point five for that? Mm-hmm. Right, okay. But it is gonna be part of the total cost, and there's nowhere else we can we can put that in, is there? There's nowhere else we can code for the the rubber used in the casing. So do we not have to account for it in the cost somewhere there? Okay. Mm. Might do, if we go for some of the more exotic aubergines and such like colours. S Has that not made any d if you click off that square now, has that not made any difference? Is it oh, it's brought it slightly down. So is is uncurved completely and just actually making the rubber case the curved thing, is that going to make a difference? Oh, it's not made any difference, has it?. It's gone up again. Oh. It's brought it down slightly. Is there anything on the menu No. If we tr um. If we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery and just went with the standard batteries, would that make a huge difference? And people are used to buying batteries, they're not gonna say I'm not getting this, 'cause I've got to buy a battery for a remote control. Should we see what difference it makes? Um Yeah. Sure. But we're still working to um head o We can put in our recommendations. If we if we're working to head office specifications as this is what this project team's working for, we can put in our recommendations for what we've we've found and what we the consensus that we've come to as a result of the meetings. But we need to work to that specification to start with. And I think the voice recognition sounds wonderful, but our object is so distinctive that that in itself is gonna make it easier to locate as a f you know in a first instance. Um as you say, we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers and so Mm. Yeah. 'Cause we've done all the background work to go for that if they want it. Yeah. So if we take voice recognition out we are. Are you sure? Sorry, not meaning to doubt your words there. Right. Are they really going to quibble about ten P_? Or point zero one of a Euro? Which is less than ten P_. That's today's kick off meeting,. Mm. I thought that's what it was. So we're okay. Although we had our separate tasks, there was so much interaction, so much that we needed to um bounce off each other. And I've certainly felt heard, listened to in that in relevant areas we've been able to, you know, give and take and adjust our remit where necessary. Yeah. Maybe we should think of branching out into children's toys and fake mobile phones as a side line. And fake R_C_s. How do we evaluate the materials we had for communicating and sharing information? Could it've been better, was it adequate? Mm. Yeah. Yeah. It's really borrowing from other areas, it's, you know, bringing things from other areas in, it so it's I mean nothing is new, but it's applying it to a d in a different area. Absolutely, yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, the focus isn't on to that, yeah. I think it's really good that this has been very market research based, because just going back to mobile phones, I mean this is the first change in remote control devices that I can really, you know, say is is obvious and visible. We see it in mobile phones a lot, and tha that's where we've borrowed a lot of our ide our ideas from. There are innovations in that that people don't really want. I see people wanting a model of the phone they were really happy with, and they can't get it anymore and it's innovation for innovation's sake, and I think it's wonderful our company's so R_ and D_ based. Yeah. But forcing it onto people, yeah. It's things that, you know, they might want to buy the thing they really want. Mm. Mm. Or there isn't a cover to fit it or whatever, yeah. See I think I think it was just the produc uh just the production cost of the phone. Mm-hmm. But I think in the remit that we were given, it was very specific. I think we've done what we were required to do, and I think there'll have to be another project team or a new project for us to look at at those kind of things. I don't think that's something we have to look at and find a way of raising the cash for. I think we've done very well to get within budget and it still makes such an innovative item that I think people are really gonna want. I know. Maybe it will. Maybe they are gonna steal our ideas and sell it. Mm-hmm. Questionnaire. Questionnaire done. Oh, I didn't have to rate you on how much you influenced the meeting this time. Oh, right. But do we not sometimes evaluate in these meetings too? Yeah.
If you leave them on the whole time you get to look like a noodle the whole time. Is that. three, apparently. Okay, you all switched on. I presume we're good to go. Okay, um minutes um we decided to use a kinetic charger, standard chip, um 'cause it can come in various different sizes, it wasn't uh uh gonna be a problem factor. We wanted a stand-by function. The case material is gonna be soft, rubbery, changeable. Um buttons with a combination of L_C_D_ and rubber according to the design. Um bright funky designs inspired by fruit, keeping with the hip kind of feel. Um and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that. Um and the rubber buttons that we'll use will be anti-R_S_I_. Okay? Prototype presentation. I think that would be you. Make sure the camera's Yes, yes you can. Wait a second, I'll get it out. Um Okay. You should have one of those things and you can just take it off. Ta-da. Right. Mm 'kay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm. So it's flush. Oh right, okay, yeah. So put it in the top section rather than the bottom sections, 'cause it's the top part that's okay. Okay. I'm under the sofa. Or, that would be too complicated. Infrared. Like here. Okay. Actually, no, it would be it would have to be on the on the front. Oh right, yeah, okay, yeah, I've got you. It's still pointing, yes. Yeah, that would make sense. Okay. But not interfering with the outside kind of look of the product once it's Okay. Thank you very much. Wrapping it all up, okay. Um I've now got evaluation criteria. It's to be presented. Okay. It's quite similar to what it was before, though. Sorry. Mm-hmm. Okay. Just write small. Yeah. That works. Mm-hmm. I would agree. Okay. I would say two. A two. It's just two point five for that one. I would say a two. I would say a two. One point seven f five. Okay, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. One. Well the type of button that we're gonna use in the bottom half, the material, minimises R_S_I_ it's meant to. Um maybe because it's slightl with the size that we've got it's quite small, but with the amount of stuff we're putting on it isn't that much. So maybe because there's more space, it's not kind of moving around trying to hit accurately the buttons in between. It's quite obvious just big buttons. Um Four. A standard. It would be. And if you didn't hear it in the room that you were standing in, then you'd realise that it wasn't in that room, you'd go into another room. One. I don't think so. I think we yeah. I think we're set. Do much apart from having a huge big Don't think so. Okay, thank you. Okay, I've got finance here now. I'm gonna plug this in so you can all see it, if that's okay. Um. Thanks. Right. Now I presume that the screen will go blank, that um Okay. We just type numbers into this and we come out with the final value. So are we still on for kinetic? Okay. See, it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning. Um it might have influenced our choice. Right, what's happening with the electronics? Double-curved. Oh, right, okay. Thanks. So, would there be two? One chip. Okay. One double curve. So what's a single curve then? So just one double Yeah. Um Mm. Um we've got plastic and rubber, haven't we?. Um Do you think? Okay. It would be like saying we're using See, it says case material. So we're not actually using plastic in the case, are we? It's including, it's including. Okay, we'll just put it in as we'll put in as half. Or sh we should just put it in as one, because the plastic is zero anyway. No, we don't step on anyone's toes. Okay, special colour, do we need that? N yeah, okay. Interface. Buttons Has that not gone up? Oh no, it was seven five it's changed not a lot. Oh, it's not calculated it. Okay, there we go. It's not a lot though. We haven't been dealin we haven't been dealing with dollars though, I think Okay, so the highest we've got is the electronics here. Um and the interface. Where's the where's the voice recognition? Right, okay. Well the kinetic is three. If we change it to the battery it's that's minus three. Oh, right. I keep seeing zero. Um We can do it some other way, we can do it doesn't have to be voice recognition. We could do the voice recognition for, you know, business class or something, you know, like an upgraded version. You could choose to have that or not. So should we just change the design specification then? Yes. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay, we can make the price fit, and then say if we'd had our budget, we would've had this, because it also sets it apart from the crowd. They like their gadgets, they like something that's completely different. It's s something completely different associated with your company. Right, okay, so It's two point five. No, it's twelve point two five. Yeah well two, twelve point two five times two is twenty five, isn't it? I think the agenda one was where the um price was, wasn't it? No. Twelve point five. Well done, people. So is that uh got us covered for the electronics then? We don't need something else to take that place? Okay. Okay. Right, so we've done that. Okay. Product evaluation. We've done room for creativity, haven't we? Because we've got decisions that we would have made that we weren't didn't feel able to make. Um I presume we discussed leadership and teamwork. um in the sense that um did you feel like a team? Or did you feel like uh autonomy? Mm-hmm. Thank you. How did you find it? Yeah. Yeah. I liked the fact that we could say an idea and it'd be suggested that that wasn't the best idea, but no one felt like shot down, you know, y it didn't matter it saying what you thought, because if it wasn't something that was that relevant, then it didn't matter, 'cause it was just another idea in the field. I like that. Um teamwork. Well you two created that wonderful specimen of a Play-Doh model. Um uh I'm still not caught up. But that's nothing to do with the teamwork at all. Um Maybe. No, that was quite fun. Um means, whiteboard, digital pens, etcetera, what does that mean? Any ideas? Had time to kind of Yeah, 'cause we could just sort of say, sorry what did you say about that or what do you think about that, rather than having to email it, yeah. But it was nice having it there. Um like the whole picture of the thing. Yeah, I think it's new ideas in general, rather than Mm. Yeah, no. Well they have to come from somewhere, don't they? And as sh as w sorry, you go. Um as was shown by your presentation with all of the other controls, remote controls, no one's thought about it particularly. I mean they're slightly different, so if someone's been shut in the room and said make ours a bit different from everyone else's, 'cause it's w something we should think about, but obviously no one's put any great deal of thought into it. Mm. But then when it everything is really smart, and you've just got this big chunk of black thing sitting on your coffee table, it doesn't go, I mean if you could have something that's a proper funky thing, a funky item that's individual, individual to you, I mean they could even go into um you go in with an idea and they design it on Photoshop and then they just get it printed on the plastic, you would pray you would pay a lot extra, because it's individually being a plastic was being made for you. But people could have anything that they wanted. Because of the produ Mm. Yes. Yeah. Well, it's innovation for money's sake. The the people have to keep buying. Yeah. And you can't get you've got your handset that works fine, but you can't get the battery anymore for that type of phone, because the phones have moved on, things like that. Yes. It's madness. Um In closing There we go. Um our costs are below budget with recommendations that they the budget be increased, but I think I don't know, d what do you think? Do you think that's takes into account um overheads like us being well paid kind of a thing? And the heating for the building, do you think our budget includes everything, all the costs that are going out? So it looks well it looks like it's gonna be fifty percent profit, you've still got all of the overheads to come out of that. So maybe increasing it, you would also have to increase the price that it's sold at. But I think but you were saying that that's quite Hmm. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. It's a shame it won't ever get made. Maybe it will. Maybe someone'll r run down and patent it. Um the project has been evaluated well and truly. Um and we've got the meeting survey and questionnaire. Oh, so we've got about fifty minutes to catch up with everything that I fell behind with, so I'll be delegating in my um role as Project Supervisor, so good luck. I think the celebration is the twenty five pounds. Either that or we'll be dancing on the desks. Oh. Um yeah, just the last, I think. I think I've got minutes for two of the meeting and the last thingy. I just got con
Hmm. Thank you. Hmm. Hmm. Yep, me too. Mm-hmm. Yep. Me and William worked on a prototype, and I think William is going to make a p presentation on that. Yeah. I can hold it like Yeah, so It looks crazy. Um not now. Oh. Yeah. Oh, where are the hinges? 'Kay. You able to look? Yep.. The black and white touch screen wherein people can Right. Mm-hmm. 'Kay. Ah oka Infrared could be here also. Yeah, here.. So when it's even if it's open here, the signals would go. Yeah. This one right here.. Which is No. Look up to it. Yay. So this is the one. Sorry. Evaluation.. Mm um I I think this is chip. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Ah, it's perfect. Is it everybody is going to evaluate, or just the Market okay. 'Kay. Yeah, so you can 'Kay. I would say four. Mm-hmm. Almost three. I think yeah. Oh sorry, I I got it wrong. The first one rating, I'm sorry. Can you just make it two? The first. Yeah, I I just it the other way. Uh in Yep, I just got two point f One is a, seven is false, okay. Two. Two. White. With for the plastic? Uh blue. Any Right. Mm-hmm. Yeah, because you'll be having a Because of the rubber case. One. Mm. Four. Voice r recognition. Hmm. You want me to b unplug that? That's all. Yes. Okay. Chip on print. Okay. Yep. Single-curved. Two curves, yeah. Single-cu. Plastic and rubber. Yeah. Plastic one and maybe rubber point five. No I think rubber, since it's being used just as a casing, we can put point five. Yeah, because there are I think it allows the point five, yeah. We can use that. It means we are not using a lot of rubber actually. We're using just a very low quantity of rubber compared to plastic. Push-button. One. An One. I think we could change the battery also. Instead of going for kinetic how about going for a standard battery. Uncurved, flat. No, it just surprises one.. I don't think so. Ri I think it's in Euro. And going to a regular bat Yeah. What I feel is, customers never said anything about the battery. It's internal, nobody looks into the battery. But shape and colours, that's something we shouldn't comprimi Where's that special form? Mm mm mm. Mm-hmm. Make it costly. Yeah we are close to the budget. Two five. It's twelve point five maybe, then. I don't know what it said fifty percent of the cost. So half of the price would be I think it is the first one. So we are under the budget. Seems fine. Except voice recognition, everything is Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I think we had a nice time. Yeah, I think there was uh very constructive feedback by everybody. It's not like people trying to cut each other. There is more of uh true cohesive teamwork. We came to a very predic creative design, yeah. Yeah, and uh Yeah, I think. And Sarah, you coordinated the work very well. Yeah. I think that was the best part of the 'Kay. Yeah, moving around the room. But I think it's good, like uh we spent times individually. I never thought of a remote control with a flip top. That's mine. Yeah, it's The thing is Yep, sorry, go on Sarah. Surprising to me is like uh people give a lot of attention to modifying mobile phones, like a real want to see a new launch or something like that. And new f television products coming up, but nobody giving uh much idea to this. Like Sarah was telling, everything's Right. Mm-hmm. Maybe fifty percent more. Yeah. Who knows? Yeah. There's a final questionnaire. Celebration, you didn't talk about that. Yeah.



@highlight

um we decided to use a kinetic charger , standard chip , um 'cause it can come in various different sizes , We wanted a stand-by function .

@highlight

The case material is gonna be soft , rubbery , changeable .

@highlight

Um buttons with a combination of L_C_D_ and rubber according to the design .

@highlight

Um bright funky designs inspired by fruit , keeping with the hip kind of feel .

@highlight

Um and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that .

@highlight

Prototype presentation .

@highlight

Um and the rubber buttons that we'll use will be anti-R_S_I_ .

@highlight

Me and William worked on a prototype , and I think William is going to make a p presentation on that .

@highlight

I can hold it like and I'll I'll show you the presentation .

@highlight

And we'll first look at the exterior of what we've uh come up with over there .

@highlight

Um It's gonna have a a plastic body um with a sort of standard colour , either we're thinking some something fairly neutral like a a white or a light blue or something .

@highlight

This is underneath the rubberised the rubberised uh outer casing um which there'd be sort of a wide choice Um the um wide choice of colours and sort of patterns , Um it's obviously an a sort of clam-shell design and uh the um the top L_C_D_ screen that you can see that would b would be sort of um how do you say , it's yeah yeah , it would be sort of inset into the into the top The black and white touch screen and the buttons at the bottom would d so so it'll fully close flat .

@highlight

we've um already said d decided on the kinetic batteries , which actually , thinking about it now , could y could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well , So put it in the top section rather than the bottom sections , Um we decided that um the voice recognition system , it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in and they were fairly easy to get a-hold of , so we presumed that they'd also be quite cheap .

@highlight

So you'd have something like where you'd shout out , where where is the remote and it'll shout back , I'm here , or something .

@highlight

Um the standard , there's be a standard transmission with the T_V_ using using all the standard chips that we've talked about .

@highlight

obviously 'cause it's split over two two different layers , it would need two separate P_C_B_s , so it would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling .

@highlight

And uh because , obviously , all T_V_s use this , the same infrared medium , we'd just be using using the same thing to transmit the data .

@highlight

And the infrared um sender would be on the on one of the bot the bottom layer , just at the front of the So when you've actually got it open , it would be facing the T_V_ .

@highlight

And then finally um on to the interface .

@highlight

The top screen , as we said , is would be an inset um black and white L_C_D_ s touch screen which yeah would uh have all of all of the the available functions for for the remote on it , uh whereas the bot the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons , like the vo volume up and down , channel up and down , power on and off , and uh things to that effect .

@highlight

And now we've we also decided on the inside , we could possibly either have um some some kind of sort of bezzled uh logo on it , or something inset , or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top .

@highlight

But not interfering with the outside kind of look of the product And finally that's how we put the fashion back into electronics , as that is that's the company logo .

@highlight

Um I've now got evaluation criteria .

@highlight

This stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research .

@highlight

the collection of the criteria , as we saw in our previous meeting , was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company .

@highlight

are we actually meeting those trends and requirements ?

@highlight

So it's what we've discussed in the last meeting , The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel , technological innovation , it should be easy to use , it should incorporate current fashion trends , and those the two main ones , they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours .

@highlight

The design should minimise R_S_I_ and be easy to locate and we were still um uh slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there , though that did seem to be the favoured strategy , We're going to use a seven point scale , where one is true and seven is false .

@highlight

and I will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here .

@highlight

Is it everybody is going to evaluate , or just the Market w we'll discuss each one and we'll come to a consensus rating between one and seven .

@highlight

I won't write all of that out again .

@highlight

It will just be criteria one , two , three , four , five , six , Actually , it might be an idea , if we each did give our own individual rating , and we could take an average at the end .

@highlight

So I'll just separate the ratings by obliques , and if we go one , two , three , four , we know who's who .

@highlight

Criteria A_ , the fancy look and feel .

@highlight

My own rating for that would be a two .

@highlight

Two and three quarters ?

@highlight

criteria B_ , criterion B_ , technologically innovative .

@highlight

I would give that a three .

@highlight

I'd give it a one .

@highlight

It's just two point five for that one .

@highlight

ease of use .

@highlight

Based on what you've said there , I would say a one , true .

@highlight

I would say a two .

@highlight

I would say a two .

@highlight

One point seven f five .

@highlight

it incorporates current fashion trends , I'm just thinking , before I give it my rating , you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here .

@highlight

Is this actually going to be the colours that you would use ?

@highlight

the the base colour was um white or or like or l sort of a light blue , but the changeable fa faces would uh allow you to get any basically any one of a number of colours that uh th it's full sort of customised .

@highlight

So we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and that's what we're intending to do .

@highlight

'cause th that's that's the the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put round it , In that case it's got to be a one for me .

@highlight

Yeah , I'll give it a one as well .

@highlight

to does the design minimise repetitive strain injury .

@highlight

I don't think we've really touched on that a lot .

@highlight

we haven't really come up with anything that we felt could feasibly reduce that .

@highlight

but the very use of a remote control , if you're someone who's zapping , who's sitting like that , and we found so many people did , how do you minimise that on such a small device ?

@highlight

the type of button that we're gonna use in the bottom half , the material , minimises R_S_I_ but with the amount of stuff we're putting on it isn't that much .

@highlight

I think I'm gonna have to be neutral on that and give it a four .

@highlight

I'd uh I'd f I'd go for a five , actually , And finally , last but not least , easy to locate .

@highlight

Now we talked about voice recognition , we talked about a beeper , Yeah , it was it was uh a voice voice recognition , have the designers come to any dec real decision on that ?

@highlight

And are we happy with the costs on that ?

@highlight

That is going to be feasible , cost-wise .

@highlight

Yeah , yeah , that yeah , that's feasible .

@highlight

And if you didn't hear it in the room that you were standing in , then you'd realise that it wasn't in that room , you'd go into another room .

@highlight

it would be quite loud .

@highlight

That's a one for me .

@highlight

I do realise that we might be being fairly biased , 'cause it is our product , We've got our our we've got the highest rating of meeting the specifications that is definitely true for two of the uh six criteria there .

@highlight

That is for um incorporates current fashion trends and is easy to locate .

@highlight

The lowest rating we've got , which is really n it's not terribly low , i it's close around neutral is for uh the minimisation of repetitive strain injury .

@highlight

Do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it , or do we have to make further modifications ?

@highlight

I don't think so .

@highlight

We happy to go ahead ?

@highlight

I think we yeah .

@highlight

I think we're set .

@highlight

I think for most of those ratings that it's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that , I'll just leave it there .

@highlight

I've got finance here now .

@highlight

We just type numbers into this and we come out with the final value .

@highlight

So are we still on for kinetic ?

@highlight

Yeah .

@highlight

See , it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning .

@highlight

Um it might have influenced our choice .

@highlight

It was a regular chip on print you you've put in three for the number of kinetic cells , there should just be one .

@highlight

one of them and one sample sensor and sample speaker .

@highlight

One double curve .

@highlight

'cause it's two .

@highlight

what's a single curve then ?

@highlight

It would just be a flat bottom with one curve .

@highlight

like a domed thing .

@highlight

Um we've got plastic and rubber , I think rubber , since it's being used just as a casing , See , it says case material .

@highlight

we're not actually using plastic in the case , There's nowhere else we can code for the the rubber used in the casing .

@highlight

So do we not have to account for it in the cost somewhere there ?

@highlight

Or sh we should just put it in as one , because the plastic is zero anyway .

@highlight

special colour , do we need that ?

@highlight

Might do , if we go for some of the more exotic aubergines and such like colours .

@highlight

the push-button's one and L_C_ display one .

@highlight

I think we could change the battery also .

@highlight

Instead of going for kinetic how about going for a standard battery .

@highlight

and I really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities , we could actually do much more to minimise that .

@highlight

and just actually making the rubber case the curved thing , is that going to make a difference ?

@highlight

so the highest we've got is the electronics here .

@highlight

Um and the interface .

@highlight

If we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery and just went with the standard batteries , would that make a huge difference ?

@highlight

it um it would make one difference .

@highlight

What I feel is , customers never said anything about the battery .

@highlight

but if you take away the voice recognition , then you've got it .

@highlight

If you took away that , that'll make it twelve point three five .

@highlight

If we change it to the battery it's that's minus three .

@highlight

We could do the voice recognition for , you know , business class or something , you know , like an upgraded version .

@highlight

I don't see why we have to sell it for twenty five Euros now , because they w they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product .

@highlight

We can put in our recommendations .

@highlight

If we if we're working to head office specifications as this is what this project team's working for , we can put in our recommendations for what we've we've found and what we the consensus that we've come to as a result of the meetings .

@highlight

Um as you say , we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers So if we take voice recognition out That'll do it .

@highlight

Twelve point three five .

@highlight

Is it twelve point fif was it twelve point fifty ?

@highlight

we are close to the budget .

@highlight

So we are under the budget .

@highlight

Product evaluation .

@highlight

We've done room for creativity , Because we've got decisions that we would have made that we weren't didn't feel able to make .

@highlight

Um I presume we discussed leadership and teamwork .

@highlight

Although we had our separate tasks , I think we had a nice time .

@highlight

there was so much interaction , so much that we needed to um bounce off each other .

@highlight

in that in relevant areas we've been able to , you know , give and take and adjust our remit where necessary .

@highlight

Yeah , I think there was uh very constructive feedback by everybody .

@highlight

We came to a very predic creative design , yeah .

@highlight

And Sarah , you coordinated the work very well .

@highlight

I think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually if if if we'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out , I think maybe it would've come out a d little different , although we didn't quite make the voice recognition in there , but that's that's good .

@highlight

I liked the fact that we could say an idea and it'd be suggested that that wasn't the best idea , but no one felt like shot down , you two created that wonderful specimen of a Play-Doh model .

@highlight

Um means , whiteboard , digital pens , etcetera , what does that mean ?

@highlight

Any ideas ?

@highlight

How do we evaluate the materials we had for communicating and sharing information ?

@highlight

Could it've been better , I think I think we probably woulda used the outer email system more , had we actually had had more time and if we'd been separated more .

@highlight

I think it's new ideas in general , It's really borrowing from other areas , it's , you know , bringing things from other areas in , Surprising to me is like uh people give a lot of attention to modifying mobile phones , like a real want to see a new launch or something like that .

@highlight

but nobody giving uh much idea to this .

@highlight

I think it's really good that this has been very market research based , because just going back to mobile phones , I mean this is the first change in remote control devices that I can really , you know , say is is obvious and visible .

@highlight

We see it in mobile phones a lot , and tha that's where we've borrowed a lot of our ide our ideas from .

@highlight

There are innovations in that that people don't really want .

@highlight

and I think it's wonderful our company's so R_ and D_ based .

@highlight

Um our costs are below budget with recommendations that they the budget be increased , Do you think that's takes into account um overheads like us being well paid kind of a thing ?

@highlight

And the heating for the building , do you think our budget includes everything , all the costs that are going out ?

@highlight

I think it was just the produc uh just the production cost of the phone .

@highlight

I think we've done very well to get within budget Um and we've got the meeting survey and questionnaire .

@highlight

There's a final questionnaire .

@highlight

we've got about fifty minutes to catch up with everything that I fell behind with , I think I've got minutes for two of the meeting and the last thingy .
