Hold that. Okay. Okay. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. I think for us it's just like a normal whiteboard, but they'll be recording what we write down. Mm. Mm. But for us it's just like a normal whiteboard. Mm-hmm. I have to draw. M my my favourite animal. Sorry this is all tangled up here. That's better. Mm-hmm. I'm a very bad drawer. Weird. Um. You're not gonna be able to guess from my drawing. I'm a bad drawer. Okay. They're ears, by the way. No. Um close though. Okay so like a pet animal. Like a cat. No, not a cat though. Okay. So. It's not a cat, it's a dog. Yes. It's got a tail then. Yeah yeah. So do cats. And you guessed cats without a tail. Okay. Okay, there you go. So what favourite characteristics. Uh. Dogs are always friendly and loyal and fun. A horse? This is why you're the designer. And I'm marketing. Ah Mm-hmm. That's it. A blue and black zebra. The very rare blue zebras. Yes. You got a lot of room here. You can probably reach. No? I took a dog. Um. A mouse? Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. It's a very big rat. Or a very small cat. Mm 'kay. Your turn. Ah I don't know what that is. It's a bit It's a bit hard to guess. Yeah. Mm-hmm Oh, it's a shark now. Mm. Now it's a swordfish. Swordfish. Um, maybe. I've never seen one, no. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Yes. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm. I'm marketing. Yep. Mm-hmm. Anna. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Oth yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm. But we can't really design for something that hasn't been invented yet. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. But Ninety percent of the time, ninety nine percent of the time, people will be using the main functions, the volume, the different channels, so we can have all the fancy things as well but the main controls need to be very obvious and very easy to use. Mm. Mm. Mm. So try and get T_V_ manufacturers to Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Or you get it. Okay. Mm. Yours is well Yeah but the the mic should not Yeah. Mm. Can't help you with that. Okay, it's y yeah. Right. Then press uh al This. You know? Oh oh. Right well Wow. Amazing. It's working. Yeah. Under documents in the shared folder. Okay. Yeah, I guess we'll have a shared folder uh with documents that we can share. And uh, yeah. Yes. Each of us is going. Okay, shall I start? So, i But it's Actually, I think I cannot go with uh Yeah. Okay. You're on the knife. Mael. Yeah, I think I will go without without it, right? Yeah. And we should sum up its favourite charas characteristics, right? So Uh yeah. And i Th They like to sleep, that's why you said you they are like this. Yeah. She has the small legs. Yeah. Thank you, Matthew. Perfect. Oh a rat, okay. And you, A bird. Okay, in the water. Mm. Yeah. Put it colours. Maybe it would help us. With different pen widths. Ah it's a shark, yeah. Oh. You have some in in Australia, right? Yeah. I dunno. Oh well. Yeah. Perfect. So I dunno if we need to spend time on that, actually But uh Yeah, exactly, yeah. Wow. Yeah. Per remote control, yeah? Per project. So it's half of the selling price, if I am good in mathematics. Of course. Oh you're g very good in mathematics. Four million. Yeah. And uh just before starting the detailed discussion, maybe we You are the marketing guy? Or th So you are the marketing. And you are in the u use user interface uh design. So just yeah I wanted to to be sure. And I I'm the the industrial designer okay. Because I I don't know you very well, actually, but yeah. Okay. Mael. Happy to meet you. Okay. It's very uh Uh so yeah uh Just uh on your web page but uh yeah not uh not face to face. So mm So I Like what? Like internet on the on T_V_? Yeah. Actually, yeah w Of course, and first before um designing the func well thinking about the functionalities, we need to know what are the user requirements. Um then if they need internet, then we would be able to to p to propose something with uh uh T_V_ over I_P_. But before Yeah, but w w we want to design a new one. Mm. Yeah. The Yeah, the main is browsing. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Perfect.
Okay. No I don't think so it has to be like that yeah and you have to adjust the length. Okay, and then. Yeah, s yeah, um. I think you can put anywhere you want, actually. I thin It's not a directional mic, anyway. Uh. Yeah. Last. Okay. Okay. 'Kay. Alt F_ five. So. Yes. Total. Whitebo Yeah, you can start it you know. No they will record through that. There's a sensor over there which is going to record the strokes that you make. Yeah. Yeah. 's a cat. Yeah. Ah you forget about it. Yeah, uh I think it's fine. I just don't want to carry it off. Man, this wires, eh? We need a wireless microphone. You know? Pro specially we should next project we should take l like that. So. Oh the dog doesn't have a tail? Yeah, sure, yeah. I thought so. The dogs have a tail. Yeah. It'll still not extend, right? It's not up to that. It's a horse. Ah I think you can put that. I'll tell to get it off my Uh? Mm-hmm. Oh y it's not for that. No. Okay. Yeah. So what should I draw? Mm. He has already to do cat. So The cat is going to eat the fish or the rat? Ah it's a baby shark, it looks to me, you know it's going to eat the cat rather than the cat eating the fish, no? You should go for the next one it seems to me. Twenty four. Ah yeah, the sale man, four million. They have to sell at least four million to make a profit Ah we have to make we have to sell at least four million to make our own profit. Fifty mill Of course it should have a on off button. Yeah, s and it depends what application you are using it for. You might need uh We are targ targeting the television set. So, you need to record the channels. You need to browse the browse the channels in upward downward way, Uh And Uh, and Marketing. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Oh. I'm Matthew. You know. Matth s uh Anna. And um uh Matthew, yeah. I thi think you know me, yeah? right yeah. So. So And uh, you'd need the usual ones, like the changing the volume, changing the the channel and then you uh Today we have uh um teletext and all those things. Tomorrow you might have a some more functions which might come through that, so Yeah I_P_O_ or. Now we are looking for television things or I_P_. For example personal video recorder and all those stuffs are coming up. Yeah. Ah it's it's it's it's coming up, actually. The personal video recorder and all those things it is coming up. Let's Let's take Oh in that case you can you always hook up with uh someone who is providing that and you know, you you sell their product as well as your product with them, you know. Yeah. No, it's okay, yeah I understand. So we need some numbering buttons, some teletext things and then um Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay, we are alread mm. Mm. Yeah. L Yeah, sure. Stam. Okay.
So we uh we will wait for Anna, a few minutes. I think it should work like this. So I will try to get my presentation running. Mm. It's no matter. No problem. Ah yes. I don't know. Just try. On this normal Good. Doesn't appear on the screen here. Oh. Okay. Thank you. Uh. Yes and you can put can clip it uh on your Somewhere. So, good morning, everyone. Um Welcome at uh at the kick off meeting of our uh latest project. I hope you all have been uh updated about it. Good. So w we will try to structure this uh meeting with an a with an agenda uh as presented here. Um after the opening we will tr get acquainted to each other. See what our roles are in this project. So, um We have been provided with uh some uh w technical tools to uh to communicate and to well, learn from each other's plans uh as I can say um so w we will also try to uh to get acquainted to this tools so they are also new to me I don't know whether you worked with them before. Um then we will come to the uh to the to the actual project plan. You all know I hope how it's about uh the uh new r remote control we are going going to design. Uh then we will uh discuss uh, well, how it should be and uh wh what uh what our new product should look lite like. And uh well then uh after some twenty five minutes I hope uh we can end this meeting. So. Um basically this is about a uh a new c remote control. Um We When you design a new product you of uh you of course want it to be original. Be uh we want to be distinguished, mm? People uh want to uh when they look at the shelf want to think, well that's the product I I need. So it needs to be trendy. I mean trendy is what people want, so then I w they will buy our product. But then, uh, it also should work uh user friendly and uh otherwise people uh uh well it will not be uh be rated very well in consumer uh articles and like that. So, the general outline of uh new project will be we first uh go through a functional design phase. Um You all get uh um certain task uh in this uh in this phase and uh then we will meet again and uh discuss this functional design. And the same holds for the uh ph two phases uh after this, the conceptual design and after that a a more detailed design in which the the final project should get its definite shape. Alright, but first we will do some uh tool training. In all in front of you uh you see uh the uh notebooks and w uh n note blocks and we have here a a a a white-board. And um well it should work uh I've read it from my uh from some colleague that it should work with some kind of toolbar. I didn't find out yet how it work, but maybe one of you did, so Um Yes. Do Do we have to say something about that? I I I'm not fully updated about this shared folder uh. Yes well we will then find out ho how it works. Um. Well, this seems to me, yes, some computer program but I didn't find it yet. So, we'll come to that later. So, uh now we will try out the white-board we have here. So, I would suggest uh Well, yes, um we uh we should try to t to draw on it and then well it should be smart some way. I I'm not really sure how this works, but Yes, a good idea Mael. Okay. 'Kay. You you D doesn't it work? Maybe someo Maybe maybe Anna, maybe you can start. Then he can maybe find out to get his cord right. So um L Why don't you draw uh your favourite animal on on th on the white-board. Oh, I see uh Yeah. Yes. Mm. So draw it. We will try to guess what it is. Mm. It's like a cat, so I guess it's a cat. What is this now? So, that's the cat. Oh. It's a dog. So but that's also kind of cat, isn't it? B bo both predators. So, thank you. Uh d did you uh work out cord? Okay. Yes. Yes, yes this is Yes definitely a horse. Yes. Oh very good. So I suppose it Yes. Can you can meet them in Africa, I think. Yes. Very good. So Ma Matthew? So Maybe I hope you have some space in your uh the horse of uh Mael. This looks likes a cat who has been driven over. Yes, the moustache. That's that's definitely a cat. It's quite, you know relaxed situation. Yes. Yes, okay. Th thank you, Matthew. Yes, this is certain uh some contribution to our project. So. Let's see. Which animal has not been drawn yet. So you've all drawn land animals, so why not draw an animal from the water. Mm. Yes. So Oh, yes, why not? Good idea. Why not. A swordfish. I hope it still works. So W Well, this uh this tool seemed to work. Let's continue to uh to the real stuff. Um our project uh finance uh thing. Uh when we are and when w you are uh going to design w uh we must keep in mind that the selling price of the product uh will be about twenty five Euros, so when designing a project uh I also look at you uh Mael, keep in mind uh uh uh People uh want to get the feeling this is a twenty five Euro project uh pr um product. Yes. Okay. Um more interesting for our company of course, p uh profit aim, about fifty million Euro. So we have to sell uh quite a lot of this uh um things. Uh we will try to uh to get at a international market uh so um it will be I think mainly Europe and uh Northern America, maybe some uh Asian countries. Um also important for you all is um the the product uh production cost must be maximal uh twelve uh twelve Euro and fifty cents. Yes, of course. Uh um I mean we still have to uh to make a profit, huh? You all have to be paid. Excuse me? Yes, indeed. So uh well I think w when we are working on the international market, uh in principle it has enough customers uh so when we have a good product we uh we could uh meet this this aim, I think. So, that about finance. And uh now just let have some discussion about what is a good remote control and uh well keep in mind this this first point, it has to be original, it has to be trendy, it has to be user friendly. Um, maybe someone can mention some additional uh prerequisites for a good remote control. Yes, well i it should have the the the the expected functionality uh of a remote control. We wer we were thinking television. Uh. Mm-hmm. Yes, yes. Th th that's very handy I I always miss it and on some remote controls that you can go channel up or down ins instead of retyping the number, especially when you have a lot of channels. Yes. Yes. A and I'm Nanne. So Yes. So. Um S S s Are there some other very important things to to do well, to specify in this first phase of of the project. So the browse function, as you m mentioned. Yes. Yeah. Yes. Mm, well uh I I think Uh w y you two should should, I think, think this over uh w espec what, what functionality. Mm-hmm. Mm mm mm. Keep k keep in mind i it's a it's a twenty five Euro unit, so uh uh the the very fancy stuff uh w we can leave that out, I think. So twenty five Euro you expect a quite, well normal but good functioning user friendly remote control. Yes, but but but ab about the spec the buttons, the buttons uh that will be on it. I I think we can discuss that in the in the next meeting. Uh I would like to get this wrapped up and go to an end of this meeting. So So you know now the basic the basic things. And well just just for the next meeting, um well, uh, you wor yes, work on a design, keep it general, I mean so w we will be still fle flexible with maybe adding some functions. So Um you will be working on on technical function design, so And uh you and you and uh uh uh well, think about requirements, eh? Does it need internet, or or do do we stay at basic basic television uh interface. So, uh I think we should now all go work uh uh at this and uh you will be informed via email and other kind of communication. So next meeting will be in uh in thirty minutes uh. K keep it in mind.

I've read it from my uh from some colleague that it should work with some kind of toolbar .

@highlight

I didn't find out yet how it work , Under documents in the shared folder .

@highlight

I I I'm not fully updated about this shared folder uh .

@highlight

I guess we'll have a shared folder uh with documents that we can share .

@highlight

now we will try out the white-board we have here .

@highlight

Each of us is going .

@highlight

I I'm not really sure how this works , but shall I start ?

@highlight

I think for us it's just like a normal whiteboard , but they'll be recording what we write down .

@highlight

Maybe maybe Anna , maybe you can start .

@highlight

Why don't you draw uh your favourite animal on on th on the white-board .

@highlight

@highlight

A blue and black zebra .

@highlight

That's that's definitely a cat .

@highlight

it's a shark , Let's continue to uh to the real stuff .

@highlight

Um our project uh finance uh thing .

@highlight

Uh when we are and when w you are uh going to design w uh we must keep in mind that the selling price of the product uh will be about twenty five Euros , more interesting for our company of course , p uh profit aim , about fifty million Euro .

@highlight

to get at a international market Um also important for you all is um the the product uh production cost must be maximal uh twelve uh twelve Euro and fifty cents .

@highlight

They have to sell at least four million to make a profit I think w when we are working on the international market , uh in principle it has enough customers And uh now just let have some discussion about what is a good remote control and uh well keep in mind this this first point , it has to be original , it has to be trendy , it has to be user friendly .

@highlight

Um , maybe someone can mention some additional uh prerequisites for a good remote control .

@highlight

Of course it should have a on off button .

@highlight

i it should have the the the the expected functionality uh of a remote control .

@highlight

We are targ targeting the television set .

@highlight

You need to browse the browse the channels in upward downward way , you need to record the channels .

@highlight

And uh just before starting the detailed discussion , maybe we are the marketing guy ?

@highlight

Or I'm marketing .

@highlight

And you are in the u use user interface uh design .

@highlight

And I I'm the the industrial designer I'm Matthew .

@highlight

You know .

@highlight

Mael .

@highlight

Anna .

@highlight

A and I'm Nanne .

@highlight

Are there some other very important things to to do well , the browse function , as you m mentioned .

@highlight

And uh , you'd need the usual ones , like the changing the volume , changing the the channel Today we have uh um teletext and all those things .

@highlight

Tomorrow you might have a some more functions For example personal video recorder and all those stuffs are coming up .

@highlight

But we can't really design for something that hasn't been invented yet .

@highlight

Uh w y you two should should , I think , think this over uh w espec what , what functionality .

@highlight

thinking about the functionalities , we need to know what are the user requirements .

@highlight

and first before um designing the func But Ninety percent of the time , ninety nine percent of the time , people will be using the main functions , the volume , the different channels , we can have all the fancy things as well but the main controls need to be very obvious and very easy to use .

@highlight

Mm mm mm .

@highlight

Keep k keep in mind i it's a it's a twenty five Euro unit , so uh uh the the very fancy stuff uh w we can leave that out , I think .

@highlight

twenty five Euro you expect a quite , well normal but good functioning user friendly remote control .

@highlight

So we need some numbering buttons , some teletext things the main is browsing .

@highlight

Yeah .

@highlight

but but but ab about the spec the buttons , the buttons uh that will be on it .

@highlight

I I think we can discuss that in the in the next meeting .

@highlight

Uh I would like to get this wrapped up you know now the basic the basic things .

@highlight

just just for the next meeting , um well , uh , you wor yes , work on a design , I mean so w we will be still fle flexible with maybe adding some functions .

@highlight

Um you will be working on on technical function design , so And uh you and you and uh uh uh well , think about requirements , Does it need internet , or or do do we stay at basic basic television uh interface .

@highlight

and uh you will be informed via email and other kind of communication .

@highlight

next meeting will be in uh in thirty minutes uh .
