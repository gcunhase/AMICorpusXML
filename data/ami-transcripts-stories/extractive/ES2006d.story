I'm proud of it. Uh-huh. How how much do we have, forty minutes? Yeah. Okay, so. Presentation. Okay. Okay. So um basically going with our trend of vegetables and we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana. Um Yeah. Um Yeah. Um so basically it's the it's the flip open thing again. So now we we have the okay, so Ma Maarika will explain you the user interface there. And it flips open on the side, so it opens like that. And we have the user interface o in here and uh the the L_C_D_ and and the scroll are inside. Um well, everything else is probably user interface, so. Yeah, yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah, it has, yeah. Yeah, well, but i since it's made of rubber anyway. I I think it's it's uh Yeah. Mm. Hmm. It's on the side. Uh no, we we'd not put so on on the cover we have the the bare essentials. Uh on the L_C_D_ we r you know, the main menu will have various options. Mm. Mm. Yeah, it's hidden in there somewhere. Cool. We ran out of resources here, so. You can have a look. Yeah, see the budget. I guess we'll give it maximum points in everything. So? Yes. Okay. But we can we can I can I can take note uh uh Um the the only thing that we were considering was that uh this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people, so if you're left-handed you're kind of left uh scrolling with your finger. But then yeah. Yeah. So bu it's it's not a huge problem, because i i it is operatable. Right. Yeah. Yep. Mm. Mm. One more thing is that i It might be a little clumsy when when it opens up, right, so it opens on the side. So Yeah yeah yeah, I mean yeah. So you guys can decide wh whether Oops. Yeah, but we which makes it kind of really big, yeah. Uh this this kind of uh makes it more and two, it might interfere with the I_R_ channel. Okay. Right. Okay. No, we have a locator. Yeah. Yeah. Intuitive, completely intuitive. Intuitive. And uh even the scroll, it's a it's a new technology so m m might be a little more difficult for people to get used to in the beginni so it is kind of not very intuitive but uh it's a good technology, I mean once they get used to it. Yeah. So l Yeah, okay. I'm gonna give a seven in everything, so. Mm.. Yeah. Yeah, unless you are a all the time sitting. Yeah. Yeah, I I think it is ergonomic. Mm yeah. And moreover it it has um L_C_D_ and everything, so that uh you know uh we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway. Absolutely. So it has voice control. Yep. Anyway it ha yeah, it's the most sophisticated remote that I ever seen. Yeah, but they've been brought together in a remote. Yeah. Absolutely. The carrot banana remote. I think that's a. Yeah. There are how many sixes? One, two, three. Three. And one five. Okay, twenty eight, thirty eight, fo forty six. Forty six and five, fifty one. Fifty one divided by Mm I guess it'll have to wait for a bit. Mm. Advanced, yeah. Yep. Mm anything uh I think which is not more. Yeah. Mm. No uh we we have uh yeah. Mm no. We don't have we're not using any of that. Huh? Wh wh what is the limit? Uh. Mm I don't think so, no. No it says what what is the kind of interface, if it is pushbutton then you got a zero point five, it's a scroll wheel so we we've put it's pushbutton and scroll wheel and L_C_D_ display, so that's that's the three kind of interfaces that we have. Wh wh what's our criteria? Uh okay. Uh it does not have for voice recognition, but it does have for the feedback speaker. when you say when you press one it says one or it says hello. Mm and the locator also goes away. A also i in the case I'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface, because it's just rubber, so it's probably a flat surface rubber. Uh I mean uh um yeah. Um So tha that mean that we cannot press how do we how do we make a selection in uh in the L_C_D_? If in the L_C_D_ we can scroll, right? But how do we make a selection if we d cannot push the button. No w w w but ha it's it's the scroll wheel and I thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and pushbutton thing. That comes with the L_C_D_? Oh so so the the this is. So we're adding costs for right, okay uh I mean I think this is good. Instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here, up for up and down. On the side. Mm uh it sounds good actually, yeah.. We have, yeah. Not really, no. Because we keep all the features, we keep voice recognition, we keep L_C_D_ display. We instead of having scrolling we we just push the buttons. Um yeah. Yeah. But we lose the locator. So instead of speaker,. 'Kay. I think it mm I think uh n one thing that was lacking uh was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with. Um we kap kept a adding things randomly. So, had we known Yeah, that or not, yeah. Yeah. So d all the random decisions at the end could have been prevented. Mm. Yeah, mm. Yeah yeah yeah, that's it's it's I wonder what one of these costs. Yeah. Mm yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. I guess it was a fairly small group, so all of us got to express our opinions, yeah. Mm. Hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. I thought that was good though, because if you're given too much time then you got nothing to do with your time and um yeah. Although we could have made the R_s better had we had five more minute. We certainly are, mm. Yeah. Yeah, same here. Mm uh no. I don't think so. Was there a questionnaire already sent?
Okay. This is our final meeting, the detailed design meeting. And again I'll take minutes. The what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two, so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently. Um then then Cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against. Then I need to say some st a few things about finance, 'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria. Um and then we'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from Cat and the financial limits. Um and then we uh will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through. So we've got forty minutes. S 'Cause we missed out. So it's now I guess that we're supposed to start at fifteen thirty five, so we've got until four fifteen. Is that right? Yeah, until about four fifteen. So yeah. Go for it. Do you want Yes. Dual use, perfect. Dual use, perfect. Does it vibrate when you press the buttons? Sorry, sorry. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Wow. And it's the whole thing's made of rubber, is that Mm-hmm. Yeah. Huh. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Six seven eight nine. I like that. Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Y or you could have it so you on the wheel if you. But if you hold it in, if it's a scroll and click so you hold it in? no. Mm-hmm, very good. And it's with the the black and yellow you're even in the right colours. Mm-hmm. Very good, let's have a look. Test it out. Uh it's a sort of intermediate colour, I guess. Very good. Okay, so maybe if we go on to evaluation cri criteria and then we'll there I suspect we're gonna have a couple of minor finance issues, but um we'll se I'm sure we can get around them somehow. We'll just send all of our manufacturing to some nice poor country and cut some of the prices that way. Wales, for example. Marketing Expert. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So for each of these we need to give it a one to seven. Is that right? Mm dots, never mind. Yeah, I agree. Yeah, just prepare one now. I reckon it Yeah. Seven, yeah, it's terribly sexy. Yeah. Ah, okay. Excellent. Except we can't uh we can if we then yeah, I'll take a note, it's fine. Yeah. I think it does. Alright. But that's gonna be a problem, 'cause you don't always have all left-handers or all right-handers in a family. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Um Six. Yeah, I think I think for um I mean most people are right-handed, so in in terms of our greatest target group, I think it's pretty good, but we might want to flag it for management, they want might want to um They Mm-hmm. Yeah. The length is gonna be difficu Mm. No, we're gonna put it like we've got th there's the locator dot. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. I'd say six, 'cause the I mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one, rather than the way you've got it. I really like the way you have it, but it's not the immediate thing that you're used to. So Might be But it and it's something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places soon. Five? Yeah. I'm happy with five? Yeah. Yep. But otherwise it's superb. Six. Yeah. Well we've banned them from Yeah. Yeah, it's varied. Yeah. Six? Voice control have seven. Ah, that's the second one. So you must have changed it on this one where it's got score, but not on the previous slide. G_ technologically innovative. But in terms of the actual technology, none of it is actually new. Yeah. All of the components have been used in other things before. But do yeah, yeah. Yeah. What do you reckon, five, six? Yeah. Space remote. Put fashion in electronics. Very good. Yeah, one. Or a seven. Fifty one, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Six point point about six point five. Close enough. Now wait until we get to finance and then we'll see if we can afford it. That's all you've got at the moment, or did you have anything more? That's it? Alright. So, finance. And we'll see if we can unscrew this first. Sorry, this is I'm just um Beautiful. Not anymore. Computer no signal? Adjusting. There we go. Okay, so we've looked at the prototype presentation and the evaluation criteria. And now we have to calculate the production costs. So I've got an Excel spreadsheet to help us do that. Can you read that? Almost. More or less. Um I started filling it in, but of course these are provisional, so we have to go down. No hand dynamo, right? One simple battery. No kinetic energy, no solar. The chip, we're going for an advanced chip on print. We also said the sample sensor and sample speaker. Um single-curved surface, so that we can fold it. Case material we said rubber. I don't know what special colour means. It could be Rub rubber comes coloured, it's I would maybe it's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured, it's different. Yeah, let's leave it as zero, 'cause it's easy. We we're definitely going to have to so we've got pushbutton, and then we've Scroll wheel with pushbutton we had, no? S for the muting. Yeah. And button supplements. No. No? But the the spinning wheel's not there. I have think maybe it's integrated with the L_C_ display? I think the pushbutton oh. I don't know if that's one Yeah. That seems unlikely. Push what uh whether whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we I don't think that makes sense. No. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, as we can see, that's way too expensive down here. Our budget's twelve point five. Yeah, so that has implications though for the. For the locator. Yeah. Yeah. What else does it need? Yeah, 'cause the sample speaker was, I think, more complicated then just a beeping thing. Yeah, okay, so we Uh-huh. Right, so we need one fifty off. Take it down to just a scroll wheel. We could do Yeah. You can have to scroll it straight r roll it straight down for for mute. That's with the L_C_ We decided, 'cause it's not on our list. The scroll wheel is on the side. We're point three over at the moment. It's nothing n Yeah, I have Yeah. Rather than having three different things that people have to do. There we go. Oh look, we're way under budget and we'll make huge profits and we'll all get bonuses. Or or that we have to have some sort of special colour. So that's alright. We we'll leave it at that and then I'll take I can send it back to management and say we weren't quite sure about the colour, if that costs extra then we've still got some space for it, yeah. Excellent. Alright. So did we lose um on our evaluation criteria, as a result of doing that? Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Alright then. We're gonna have a beep. Yeah. Yeah. Tha. 'Cause we we won't have run out of our pot of Play-Doh. Yeah, I know I know, my pen vibrates. But only for a very short time. Um okay. So looks like we've designed a banana. Well done, team. Um we need we've just got about ten minutes or so left of the meeting, so it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went, um so that we can feed back to the management for next time they're designing a product. Feedback? Ideas? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. But in terms of the process of um going and working individually and then coming back to a meeting, that that worked in terms of. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Banana. Mm-hmm, the whiteboard digital pens. We like the pens. Yeah, you could take it to lectures and just write stuff down and have it printed out when you got back to the office. They great? Do you think they'd notice if one went? Oh okay. Yep. Shh. Yep. But that worked well having having a whiteboard that we could draw on as well as having the PowerPoint, 'cause the I find that the problem with PowerPoint often is that it's so static and you can't change it once you're in there, yep. Mm-hmm. Yeah. That's alright, that always irritates me anyway, yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. And presumably you don't you can say nasty things as well. I have no stake in it. You have to say that, 'cause I'm taking the notes. I'll leave the room and you can have another go. Better than that than the banana. I think it worked quite well. Did anyone feel that they were getting sort of covered up and not being able to say their bit? Yeah.. New ideas found. Not quite sure what about. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's right. Banana remote. Yeah. Or you can always go to Google and type in banana remote control. Flip. Vibrate. And uh yeah. Nothing that you really want. True. Yeah. Okay. So, costs are within budget, well within budget, including a little what have we got? One Euro left over for bits that we didn't foresee. Um we've evaluated the project. You've got the scores. Can you put that in the project documents file? It's in there already. And the process wheel didn't really have any major problems with. Were there any was there anything that you found difficult, or anything that didn't go as smoothly as you'd hope? Yeah. Okay then. Um I think we're still well within our time. We've got about five minutes left, but if we've finished, then we've finished. We're just too too efficient and you should never drag a meeting on just because you have extra time. So I would say that's the end of that meeting. Thank you, team. It was very productive day and Mm uh no. Right, so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it. I don't know if it's already sent or not. Um presumably I have to I don't see why you can't stay here, really. Did I save this one? Production costs. It was supposed to be pink. But it was blue on the board.
Yeah. Yeah, about four fifteen, yeah. So, you said um are are we starting with the the so will you maybe start with like the mm the shape and things and and then I will explain the the user interface th uh things, like the buttons and the scrolling things and Well, but it's it's just an a approximation. Uh yeah. Rubber. Yeah,. Um it could be made a bit smaller, and and of course it would be and yeah, but um one thing we actually kind of um forgot while designing, that one side was supposed to be rounder, so we said the back side round, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it's spongy as well. So so uh the user interface as as we discussed last time uh mm on on the on the cover we just have the very basic things. So we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one two three there would be numbers in in the on the actual one. So it's four, up to four, up to seven, up to nine and zero, z zero here. Yeah. And then, well this is on off button. It's it's quite standard mm place for it and and also the colour is quite often red, so it's it's kind of user friendly. And then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and like the previous one and the next one. And and we would also have a l little um thing saying here, previous and ne prevon prevon next. The volume is is scrolling. On the side, this one. Yeah you just do it like this. And and and it's it's on the back is mm cover or back lid, because if you flip it open, you can still do the scrolling here. See? So the volume is you just scroll, but then once you flip it open, okay, there there you have the screen and and you have the mm spinning wheel with options to choose. You can move back and forth and then if you need to m choose something on the screen, you just push the cen mm the middle button. A mute button. Well, we'll have this on the screen, on the display. Well, but the but the mute yeah, the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute, right? Okay, yeah, okay. Yeah. And okay, so i so the the voice recognition is also just part of it. You can't really see it in the interface. Yeah. And we do have the logo on it as well. So I think it Yeah. Yeah, I think um we could do l the logo in grey, as it is on the website. In the actual one. Yeah. So if you have questions. Yeah. Yeah, the yeah, it's definitely attractive. Oh, the locatable thing we actually forgot. Yeah. Shall I just prepare it now? It will be red, too. S seven was th the maximum, yeah? I I go for seven. I would think yes, yeah. Yeah, so y so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another m model another another version, which is like exactly the mirror image of this one. Yeah. But then then I think left-handed people are already used to discrimination anyway, so they just Yeah. Yeah, because I mean anyway, right-handed people would be able to scroll with it, so i if the majority are right-handed, it's uh Or maybe six, because it's just one one i one among the issues, I mean. Yeah. Yeah. No, yeah, but mm but we have it nicely with the hinges here yeah. So it won't be a problem, it will be and it will be it won't be heavy. Yeah well yeah, but it's it's a bit long. It's a little bit long. Well, I mean it can be opened like this of course and yeah. S uh slightly smaller. Yeah, but if we flip it open only as much as that. Mm that you stick on T_V_. Yeah well w but l but the speak sample speaker is included, so it it has some capacity to mm to do some to make some sounds, so yeah. Yep. Yeah. If uh uh if this means intuitive, if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things and it's I th I think it's Yeah. Yeah. Um uh the ergonom ergonomic design well mm I mean I d uh I dunno, I mean the the repetitive stress things, but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway, yeah? See. Yeah, so it's kinda Yeah. Yeah, it does have yeah. Technologi well Yeah. Well mm we have we have the sample speaker as well, which is yeah, it's kind of new. But at the same time they are all they are all relatively new. Six. I mean how how far can you go with a remote control, really? It still has to do what i what it has to do. Yeah, isn't it fashionable? Yeah, sure. It's the maximum fashion. Fruit fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days, so. So I think we've done very well, but What's the assessment? The average is about six and something. A little bit over six. No, wait, a little bit under six. No, wait. Oh, three sixes, okay, yeah. Four sevens. Six point something, yeah. Six point five, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yeah, yes. Rubber. I think something coloured, yeah, probably. So I think this is probably special co no? Yeah. Or maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing on it, yeah yeah, okay. Yeah. We have pushbuttons, scro we have scroll wheel as well. S yeah, yeah, we had, for muting, yeah. And we have L_C_ display and yeah. Um Yeah, but what do we ha we have L_C_ display, but but the wh but the s spinning wheel Yeah. Okay, let's yeah. We have to count all of them, or yeah. But it was very no innovative innovativeness. Well um yeah. Well the speaker uh the sample speaker is is expensive, but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps. This would be Yeah, yeah yeah there you record your samples your speech samples and Yeah, then then we would be in the b budget. Yeah b no no, you can push this one, but we don't have a pushbutton uh we ca we don't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing. Mm-hmm. But I mean we can put an additional mute button on the top as well. If you Mm. So Mm-hmm. Okay, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Well we're going to have a beeping thing. But yeah, it's it's not like sample speaker, but it will just beep, so we still have the locate. Which colour, the the colour of the phone or the colour of the But it can be yellow as well. It can come in the same colour as the the case. Yeah mm, as far as creativity is concerned, yeah I think there was there was room for creativity. The only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, the m the means were very very good, the means we used. And the pens. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and and and this time also the time limits but actually preparing the Yeah. But yeah, but I mean already just just preparing the slides before before the meeting, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was I was satisfied with with the leadership, yeah. Mm-hmm. And then the teamwork I think I think it worked quite quite nicely, yeah. To express them mm mm no. Well it's it's it's pretty new, pretty novel solution for a for a remote control really, all this flipping open thing and Yeah, neither neither do I, but I've never seen anything and and none of my examples were was was like this, actually, so. Yeah maybe w maybe we could have a patent on this one. Patent patent patent. Mm. Mm-hmm. Yes. Yes. And my main difficulty was the the time pressure. Otherwise it's it's all fine. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Yeah, it was a pleasure working with you. You can make some animals. Oh, you don't like anim It doesn't? Smells quite nice. Smells very sweet. I made your animal for you. Yeah, that's the one
It does look very cool. And then do we get to make a remote control? Yeah. Yeah. You think bananas are a safe thing to use? It's a bit um phallic. Oh, your remote control? Oh that's just bad. Is it to scale, or do you think you can make it a bit smaller? Yeah. It l does look like the curvy and then the whole shape's curvy, so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable. I wasn't very keen on that, but yeah. So where's the volume? Ah, you did get that in then, mm-hmm. Oh okay,. Cool. Oh, the thing we forgot was like a mute button. Yeah. On the wheel, like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute. Yeah, but it's a scroll and click, isn't it? Okay, cool. So that that solves the whole mute issue.. Yeah.. Yeah, oh, we hold the remote. Oh, but it it does feel all cold and slimy. I hate Play-Do, it's just minging. But yeah, uh that's cool, cool. Mm-hmm. Okay. Wales. Mm. Cool, okay. Right, okay. Fabulous, yeah. Okay, cool. So what we're gonna do is prefer prepare the evaluation of the new design. Um so we're gonna be using a seven point scale, so one is, you know, yes, it totally meets with that requirement and seven is, no, it really doesn't, we need to go back and start again. Um, you know. Basically, what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done and we've worked on and like made a list of them. Um you know, so that we can evaluate each one and like so it was about going back to the start and saying oh yeah, we did manage to do that, or oh no, we really forgot about that. Okay? Cool, so these are what they are. Oh Yes, I did have A_, B_, C_, and D_ down here, but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points. Okay. But if you can imagine that they say A_, B_, C_, and D_, then that would be really good. Well, I thought we'd um kinda said that you'd have a little thing to stick on the T_V_? Yeah. Cool. Okay. So, be attractive to look at. That's this one. What do you all say? Yeah. Oh we're all so proud of the. Okay, so that'll be a seven for A_. Could oh no, you can't whilst that's up there. Okay um uh what I've done on the next page is I've set it up so we just put the marks in. Yeah. But that's alright. If you take a note of them, and then I'll put them in in a minute. Okay, so we're all agreeing on seven for A_? Cool, okay. Does it match the operating behaviour of the user? Yeah. I mean Yeah. I th I think it's not it's not like it's a pen. Yeah, but I mean because it's not like it's a pen, you know, left-handed people can't normally write right-handed, but they can normally do most things right-handed, so I would say it's not such a big issue. Yeah. I mean you can you can use your finger to to scroll rather than your thumb. So I mean that does kind of negate the whole R_S_I_ issue. So maybe we need to put that needs a little bit of investigation, maybe give it a five, I would say? What do you what do you all think? Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I th I think the alternative is flipping from the top. Yeah um But you were thinking about making it smaller, yeah? Because So you have to keep that side flat. So it works like a mobile phone flipping, but y you know, as long as that side's flat, than that will work. Okay. Um okay, so C_. Are are we admitting defeat on C_ or are we saying we're gonna stick a locator on the T_V_? There's a locator. Cool, so that means you need a that does mean you need a little speaker on it though, doesn't it? To make it beep. Or a buzzer. Okay. So that's two, so that's seven, yeah. It's locatable? Fabulous. D_. Yeah. Yeah, and I mean d So, should we maybe say f a five and say it is intuitive, but it's different, so, do you know, I mean it's obvious how to use it, but you might have to think about it first. So we give that one a five, you think? Yep. I'm glad you're accepting this. It has taken a little while, hasn't it? Um intuitive but Sorry, it's really hard to write on those. I just went a bit mad, didn't I? Um okay, cool, E_, okay. Um I would guess this comes back from this whole B_ thing links in here, so possibly for left-handed. Investigate. So, should we give it a six? Six? I used to send fifty texts a day, you know, and I never got repetitive strain injury from that, so I find it quite hard to believe to be honest. Okay, so we give that a six, yeah. Okay, F_. Hang on, how come it's showing up with the things there but it only had bullet points there? That's just Oh okay, cool. Um right, so. Yes, so that's a seven then. Um, cool. Yeah, but I mean you don't They're never been used i they've never been using remote remote control before I don't think.. Yeah, what do you all think? Six? Well, that's it, I mean Yeah, but I mean everything has been used in space before it gets to anyone else really, hasn't it? So, I don't think many peop That's it, they can take it with them. So, we give it seven, and we write There we go. Cool. So, we need the average here, so we got Seven So we've got four sevens, so that's twenty eight, three sixes, eighteen. Two three four Seven eight. Okay, that's pretty good, I think. Um no, that's it, yeah. Cool, there we go.. There we go and there are the marks. Yeah. Yeah, but rubber comes coloured, doesn't it? You know. Yeah, you might end up having to take off the sample sensor.. No. We've got more than one pushbutton though, haven't we? 'Cause then you have That means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total doesn't it? Not counting anything, we'd still be in budget. Twelve point five. No. Well it doesn't, but it uh And L_C_ display. This sample sensor. Yeah, the sample sensor will have to go, 'cause that's the most expensive thing on there. Yeah. But that's a bit of a gimmick anyway really, isn't it? We can afford to get rid of it. So that means no locator, does it? I mean does Yeah. Yeah. Okay, yeah. See, I was gonna say the scroll wheel pushbutton thing, 'cause But that's well you would just have to to spin it down. So that's point three. Yeah, I mean that wouldn't actually cost any more. That's the spin wheel though, isn't it? Didn't that come with the L_C_ Yeah. Yeah. S so we're point three over. Unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether and just have pushbuttons for the volume. Could b still put them on the side. But yeah. I mean the scroll wheel's pretty cool, but Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, well we could admit to the single curve, couldn't we? Yeah, but Yeah. Yeah. No. No, I don't think so. Yeah. We just got rid of a gimmick that was never anyway, and the scroll wheel is I mean essentially the two buttons that was it's not a great difference I don't think. Really? Cool. That's not a very exciting colour. I think you should make it more vegetable-like. Oh the the beeper thing. It Yeah, I think Jen wants it to vibrate. You know, your pen vibrates? Yeah. Cool. Yeah. If we'd had that sheet at the beginning should've been like, okay, so we can have that lot, let's just throw it together and do what we can. Yeah. I think 'cause the meetings were so regular, you know. It wasn't like we were alone for very long, so you didn't st go off and think, wouldn't it be great to have a vibrating remote control shaped like a banana, and then, you know, come back three days later and Jen's going look, look, it vibrates and it looks like a banana. Um yeah, so yeah. Uh I like the pens. I want one. That would just be so cool, to d do all your notes and s I don't think you should say that was the recording. Okay, cover up the microphone. Alright, let's take it. Okay. It is a bit limiting, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. The thing flew in, you didn't have the whole whooshing thing, 'cause there wasn't time for that, so yeah. Not that you can do that on the board, either. We could make some little Yeah, totally, I mean that was fairly tight anyway, I mean especially with that last-minute alteration. back it, this is just had to be changed. And yeah, so cool. Are we supposed to say nice things about Jen now? Yeah, definitely. You weren't like a a dictating leader, so that was always good. I know you've got the pen, you might attack me with it. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know, I don't go shopping for remote controls that often, maybe somebody's already though of it. Yeah. Yeah. I'll be looking out next time I need to write an essay. That looks boring, I'll see if anyone's made a remote control. Yeah, yeah. I think we'd like to think the ideas were new, but we've got no way of finding out. That vibrates Yeah, but that would just come up with like other things really wouldn't it. Yes. And it's fabulous. It's in the project documents. Yeah, yeah, sometimes it's like a little bit rushed. Yeah, we've got like five minutes left. Yeah. 'Kay. We could draw animals on the board again. I don't like Play-Doh, no. It's just minging. It smells so bad. It does. Mm. No, it hasn't been. Do we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now? Okay, so the other way.



@highlight

This is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting .

@highlight

what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , It does look very cool .

@highlight

then Cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against .

@highlight

Then I need to say some st a few things about finance , 'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria .

@highlight

Um and then we'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from Cat and the financial limits .

@highlight

Um and then we uh will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through .

@highlight

so will you maybe start with like the mm the shape and things Okay .

@highlight

So um basically going with our trend of vegetables and we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana .

@highlight

You think bananas are a safe thing to use ?

@highlight

Well , but it's it's just an a approximation .

@highlight

Um so basically it's the it's the flip open thing again .

@highlight

And it flips open on the side , so it opens like that .

@highlight

And we have the user interface o in here and uh the the L_C_D_ and and the scroll are inside .

@highlight

And it's the whole thing's made of rubber , is that so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable .

@highlight

yeah , but um one thing we actually kind of um forgot while designing , that one side was supposed to be rounder , Is it to scale , or do you think you can make it a bit smaller ?

@highlight

Um it could be made a bit smaller , So so uh the user interface as as we discussed last time uh mm on on the on the cover we just have the very basic things .

@highlight

So we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one two three So it's four , up to four , up to seven , up to nine and zero , z zero here .

@highlight

And then , well this is on off button .

@highlight

and and also the colour is quite often red , And then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and And and we would also have a l little um thing saying here , previous and ne prevon prevon next .

@highlight

The volume is is scrolling .

@highlight

On the side , And and and it's it's on the back is mm cover or back lid , because if you flip it open , you can still do the scrolling here .

@highlight

and and you have the mm spinning wheel with options to choose .

@highlight

Oh , the thing we forgot was like a mute button .

@highlight

Well , we'll have this on the screen , on the display .

@highlight

On the wheel , like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute .

@highlight

Uh on the L_C_D_ we r you know , the main menu will have various options .

@highlight

yeah , the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute , right ?

@highlight

if it's a scroll and click so you hold it in ?

@highlight

But if you hold it in , And okay , so i so the the voice recognition is also just part of it .

@highlight

You can't really see it in the interface .

@highlight

And it's with the the black and yellow you're even in the right colours .

@highlight

Yeah , I think um we could do l the logo in grey , as it is on the website .

@highlight

I suspect we're gonna have a couple of minor finance issues , but um we'll se I'm sure we can get around them somehow .

@highlight

So what we're gonna do is prefer prepare the evaluation of the new design .

@highlight

Um so we're gonna be using a seven point scale , so one is , you know , yes , it totally meets with that requirement and seven is , no , it really doesn't , we need to go back and start again .

@highlight

Um , you know .

@highlight

Basically , what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done and we've worked on and like made a list of them .

@highlight

So for each of these we need to give it a one to seven .

@highlight

I did have A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ down here , but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points .

@highlight

Okay .

@highlight

But if you can imagine that they say A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ , then that would be really good .

@highlight

Okay um uh what I've done on the next page is I've set it up so we just put the marks in .

@highlight

If you take a note of them , left-handed people can't normally write right-handed , Um the the only thing that we were considering was that uh this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people , Does it match the operating behaviour of the user ?

@highlight

so y so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another m model another another version , which is like exactly the mirror image of this one .

@highlight

So maybe we need to put that needs a little bit of investigation , maybe give it a five , I would say ?

@highlight

Or maybe six , It might be a little clumsy when when it opens up , right , I th I think the alternative is flipping from the top .

@highlight

Yeah , but we which makes it kind of really big , yeah .

@highlight

or are we saying we're gonna stick a locator on the T_V_ ?

@highlight

th there's the locator dot .

@highlight

Mm that you stick on T_V_ .

@highlight

so that means you need a that does mean you need a little speaker on it though , To make it beep .

@highlight

so that's seven , yeah .

@highlight

If uh uh if this means intuitive , if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things I'd say six , 'cause the I mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one , rather than the way you've got it .

@highlight

but it's not the immediate thing that you're used to .

@highlight

but uh it's a good technology , I mean once they get used to it .

@highlight

So , should we maybe say f a five so possibly for left-handed .

@highlight

Investigate .

@highlight

But otherwise it's superb .

@highlight

So , should we give it a six ?

@highlight

Um uh the ergonom ergonomic design well mm I mean I d uh I dunno , I mean the the repetitive stress things , but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway , And moreover it it has um L_C_D_ and everything , so that uh you know uh we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway .

@highlight

Okay , so we give that a six , G_ technologically innovative .

@highlight

it's the most sophisticated remote that I ever seen .

@highlight

Well mm we have we have the sample speaker as well , which is yeah , it's kind of new .

@highlight

All of the components have been used in other things before .

@highlight

They're never been used i they've never been using remote remote control before I don't think .

@highlight

What do you reckon , five , six ?

@highlight

Six .

@highlight

Put fashion in electronics .

@highlight

Fruit fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days , so .

@highlight

So , we need the average here , So I think we've done very well , The average is about six and something .

@highlight

Six point five , yeah .

@highlight

that's pretty good , I think .

@highlight

so we've looked at the prototype presentation and the evaluation criteria .

@highlight

And now we have to calculate the production costs .

@highlight

So I've got an Excel spreadsheet to help us do that .

@highlight

Um I started filling it in , No hand dynamo , right ?

@highlight

One simple battery .

@highlight

The chip , we're going for an advanced chip on print .

@highlight

We also said the sample sensor and sample speaker .

@highlight

Um single-curved surface , so that we can fold it .

@highlight

Case material we said rubber .

@highlight

I don't know what special colour means .

@highlight

I think something coloured , but rubber comes coloured , doesn't it ?

@highlight

You know .

@highlight

maybe it's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured , it's different .

@highlight

Or maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing on it , We have pushbuttons , Scroll wheel with pushbutton we had , no ?

@highlight

And we have L_C_ display And button supplements .

@highlight

Yeah , but what do we ha we have L_C_ display , but but the wh but the s spinning wheel We've got more than one pushbutton though , That means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total doesn't it ?

@highlight

That seems unlikely .

@highlight

whether whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we We have to count all of them , I don't think that makes sense .

@highlight

if it is pushbutton then you got a zero point five , it's a scroll wheel so we we've put it's pushbutton and scroll wheel and L_C_D_ display , So , as we can see , that's way too expensive down here .

@highlight

Our budget's twelve point five .

@highlight

Yeah , the sample sensor will have to go , 'cause that's the most expensive thing on there .

@highlight

so that has implications though for the .

@highlight

Uh it does not have for voice recognition , but it does have for the feedback speaker .

@highlight

when you say when you press one it says one or it says hello .

@highlight

But that's a bit of a gimmick anyway really , isn't it ?

@highlight

Mm and the locator also goes away .

@highlight

Well the speaker uh the sample speaker is is expensive , but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps .

@highlight

A also i in the case I'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface , because it's just rubber , so it's probably a flat surface rubber .

@highlight

Right , so we need one fifty off .

@highlight

Take it down to just a scroll wheel .

@highlight

in the L_C_D_ we can scroll , right ?

@highlight

how do we how do we make a selection in uh in the L_C_D_ ?

@highlight

But how do we make a selection if we d cannot push the button .

@highlight

you can push this one , but we don't have a pushbutton uh we ca we don't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing .

@highlight

So that's point three .

@highlight

and I thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and pushbutton thing .

@highlight

The scroll wheel is on the side .

@highlight

We're point three over at the moment .

@highlight

Unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether and just have pushbuttons for the volume .

@highlight

Instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here , up for up and down .

@highlight

Oh look , we're way under budget Yeah , well we could admit to the single curve , couldn't we ?

@highlight

Or or that we have to have some sort of special colour .

@highlight

So did we lose um on our evaluation criteria , as a result of doing that ?

@highlight

No , I don't think so .

@highlight

Because we keep all the features , we keep voice recognition , we keep L_C_D_ display .

@highlight

instead of having scrolling we we just push the buttons .

@highlight

But we lose the locator .

@highlight

so we still have the locate .

@highlight

We're gonna have a beep .

@highlight

It can come in the same colour as the the case .

@highlight

so it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went , um so that we can feed back to the management for next time they're designing a product .

@highlight

as far as creativity is concerned , yeah I think there was there was room for creativity .

@highlight

The only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had .

@highlight

I think uh n one thing that was lacking uh was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with .

@highlight

If we'd had that sheet at the beginning should've been like , okay , so we can have that lot , let's just throw it together and do what we can .

@highlight

But in terms of the process of um going and working individually and then coming back to a meeting , that that worked in terms of .

@highlight

I think 'cause the meetings were so regular , you know .

@highlight

Yeah , the m the means were very very good , the means we used .

@highlight

the whiteboard digital pens .

@highlight

We like the pens .

@highlight

But that worked well having having a whiteboard that we could draw on as well as having the PowerPoint , I was I was satisfied with with the leadership , yeah .

@highlight

Yeah , and and and this time also the time limits but actually preparing the I mean especially with that last-minute alteration .

@highlight

I mean that was fairly tight anyway , But yeah , but I mean already just just preparing the slides before before the meeting , yeah .

@highlight

You weren't like a a dictating leader , so that was always good .

@highlight

And then the teamwork I think I think it worked quite quite nicely , yeah .

@highlight

Did anyone feel that they were getting sort of covered up and not being able to say their bit ?

@highlight

Mm .

@highlight

I guess it was a fairly small group , so all of us got to express our opinions , yeah .

@highlight

New ideas found .

@highlight

Not quite sure what about .

@highlight

Well it's it's it's pretty new , I think we'd like to think the ideas were new , costs are within budget , One Euro left over for bits that we didn't foresee .

@highlight

Um we've evaluated the project .

@highlight

Can you put that in the project documents file ?

@highlight

And the process wheel didn't really have any major problems with .

@highlight

And my main difficulty was the the time pressure .

@highlight

sometimes it's like a little bit rushed .

@highlight

we've got like five minutes left .

@highlight

but if we've finished , then we've finished .

@highlight

Yeah , it was a pleasure working with you .

@highlight

So I would say that's the end of that meeting .

@highlight

Right , so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it .

@highlight

Was there a questionnaire already sent ?

@highlight

Do we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now ?

@highlight

I don't see why you can't stay here , really .
