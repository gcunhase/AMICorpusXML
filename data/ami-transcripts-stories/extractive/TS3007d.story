Wouldn't wanna be Project Manager. Uh, what we going to do. Um, once again I'm uh gonna take minutes. So, um no presentation for me. Uh, first we have a prototype presentation by G_ and G_. Afterwards some uh eval eval evalu evaluation s sorry. Uh evaluation crit criteria. Uh, in combination with the finance I um uh I received uh a an uh an Excel uh file which we have to fill in later on. Um, you see. Uh, and then we must see uh if we uh stay under the twelve and a half Euro. So, that's uh that's a big l so let's uh wait it uh um we have we have must uh, we must have uh some time for that uh because it will be uh yeah, quite a lot of mathematics. And after that, uh uh an evaluation of uh the process how we uh how we have done it here with the SMARTboard, with the with our laptops, with the all uh all this. And uh afterwards, uh we closing. Once again, forty minutes, so uh let's start. I would g give the word to um G_ and G_ for the prototype presentation. J_ and J_. Mm. No, okay. It's called a weemote Weemote. Yeah, I can imagine that. Yeah, but uh you d you mustn't forget that uh our target aim is younger people. Uh, we had decided to uh put uh some flashy fruity colours in it, uh and uh in the survey from uh Milan and Paris uh it uh it came out that uh uh the d the older people are uh more willing to uh to spend money on extra features. So I think uh it will be a better idea to have some uh flashy fruity colours as as a standard, and for the people who uh really want uh a more sophisticated, more traditional look, they're willing to pay uh that. They want uh they want more luxury stuff, but they have the money to do it and they want to b to buy that. So, maybe it's an idea to put that as an extra and not as a standard. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But, the mai I think th uh the standard must be some kind of uh uh attractive flashy colours. Not too, but w a little, because that's our aim. Yeah. Well, the buttons don't have to be uh all uh all of yeah. It Yeah. Okay. Thank you. The Marketing Expert. Sorry. Okay, so we gon we gonna evaluate the Yeah, the the thing we saw. Okay, just saw. Yeah. Seven? Uh, true. Sorry. Yeah, one I think. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yes. No teletext buttons. Teletext is in the menu. Volume is true. Yeah, big and clear. Oh, okay. Well, I agree. I was thinking very black and white. Thank you J_. Fruity. Yeah. Well, we p we can do it glow in the dark. So, if it's in the dark place, you still see it glowing. I think Ah, you must see it as uh, w uh according to uh the the other uh remote controls, there may uh uh be there in your uh T_V_ room, this one will stand out, I think. Exa I think that that's what it's about. If it if this lying on your couch, you're you're you think what's that for kinda orange uh thing. So Yeah. Okay. That's our remote control. True. Yeah, but not too soft we have decided. Three, yeah. Easy to use. One. Yeah, can it be zero? Yeah. Okay, two. Yeah, two. What's the time? We also have uh to do the evaluation, uh the production costs and uh stuff. Yeah. You're agree, Tim? You haven't seen a more innovative uh thing in uh Paris? False. Yeah, but they are built in, so it's one. Okay. Freak. Okay, thank you. We'll see. Mm. Okay, we have now to c uh to calculate the production cost. If it's under uh twelve and half Euro, then it's uh ok uh okay. But i is it if it is b Huh? No, this isn't right. Okay so,. Redesign. Oh yeah, if they under Yeah. No. Oh yeah. Yeah, it's sorry. Yeah, if the costs are under twelve and a half Euro, uh then we uh can uh ra uh move on to the project evaluation, as we have uh experienced it. Otherwise, we have uh do uh have to do a little uh redesign uh thingy. So Uh, we have to fill in the numbers of the component uh components. We have to uh fil uh, want to uh do it in and uh see uh if we stay under the twelve and a half Euro. So, do we have uh a hand dynamo? No. That's zero. Battery, one? Okay. Kinetic, one? Okay, solar cells, zero. Okay, uh simple chip on print? No? No, advanced chip. Sample sensor sample speaker? Three? Yeah uh, but it it's one one thing, it's three Euro. Uh, what's the sample sensor? Okay. Zero. Uh, uncurved flat. No. But is it s it's not made from a single uncurved thingy and then uh and then uh no? Okay. So it's only uh once double-curved. Okay. We're now in a problem, 'cause uh we have uh reached eleven Euro yet. Okay, but uh we have Okay. Uh, rubber. You. Titanium, no? Special colour? Yeah, but we want to make uh the wood colours, uh that uh Yeah, one. Yeah, but we we going to yeah yeah, that's true. But yeah, it's it's it Okay, the push-button, no. Scroll-wheel, no. No. Oh, no. Yes, one. Uh, button, no. No, the the we don't have a s no. Okay. Oh, okay. So, um what's the thing we can change? Uh, can I uh I say something? No, can I say something uh as Project Manager? The kinetic thing, can we just skip it, because uh you have to shake it, but that's not really innovative. Yeah. Yo. Sorry, yeah, yes. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah, and not really. But we if you forget about the kinetic, well if we do that, we shall. So um Uh, b but i but the single-curved is just oh Oh, okay, okay. So that's wh tha that's one option. And then w yeah, and then we could have it, but uh it's its' well it's it's r it is the main point of the the the the look. No, tho uh that that can be done. So uh, okay, a little less uh conversation. Sorry? Fill in Just a explanation. I can delete it for you if you want. So, if we do this, uh we're on uh twelve and a half Euro. And we're done. Uh well, the only uh thing that don't Yeah, single-curved, but there's a curve in it. So Yeah, it's really a static value. Yeah. Yeah, it is. Oh. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Do you think? Well, now you can shake your remote control. Kinetic. Yeah? Who because if you want to go to kinetic, you're uh you're on thirteen and a half and you must go to flat, and I think now it's it's more of uh a compromise thing. And if you make the single curve ha just a big curve, then it's uh then it's uh yeah, one big good curve. I was going to uh say nasty words, but I don't. This is strange by the way. Wood is m is is is cheaper than rubber. We thought that wood would be more expensive. Yeah, maybe. But uh that this is this is it? Yeah. Okay, this is it. I'm gonna save it. Yeah. Okay, well, considering we have Well, we were above, so we did a little redesign Okay, um now uh it's about time to uh talk about uh this project. Uh, some uh things. Were there uh room for uh was there room for creativity in our meetings or in your individual meetings? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's true. I agree with that. Yeah. That's true. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. Okay. Uh how about the leadership? Okay, thank you very much. Now we're done. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I notice it too. I was a I was also very uh unhappy, uh very unsatisfied uh about the about the first meeting. So, uh I hope uh uh the the the other meetings uh get better and uh I think the the last two meetings uh also we we reached uh some good decisions about uh talk yeah. Okay, so uh that's cool. Uh, teamwork? Well, maybe that's uh only Yeah well, it's for us, because uh Yeah. Yeah and it's wo more like presentation and some points were discussed. But, really teamwork were you two uh The Yeah? No hard feelings. Yeah. Now you you must push a little while. Okay. O Just uh okay. You can be you can go quicker, 'cause then it it won't notice it. I follow the Master class for the SMARTboard, so I think that's the that's the main issue. Um, so uh about this one you were uh you're dealing with, um the the the the digital pen. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. No. Huh. Well Yeah. M yeah. Yeah. And it is still your own handwriting uh popping up in uh Word. No, uh that's true. No. And uh the SMARTboard is uh useful, but the the pen is I uh not user-friendly, I think. Be it it takes a lot of time to draw things and to write things, and that's the Yeah, but that's not th the the you when you at a foreign audience, you b don't gonna wr uh write uh small. Yeah. But maybe there's some function with no, it isn't. With uh Yeah. Well, I'm gonna erase my uh name. Yeah, it's a big uh big eraser. Um Well, the the idea of the touch-screen is uh I'm just uh I don't know what what I mean. No. Oh. Oh yeah. That's interesting. Okay, because what does it mean? All the mo yeah, are between one and two. Yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah, okay. Thank you, expert. But the new ideas found for uh wi with working with this uh software? Not really, yeah? Yeah, I think Yeah. Yeah. You had expected it to to be uh more more uh Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yep, yep. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, and and maybe some uh functions for uh uh uh circle or uh a square. You have to draw it yourself now. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that that can be done already. But not the the the the predefined uh squares I think uh Hmm? Sorry? Well, that's nice. Is it Here. oh. Oh, sorry. Select. Yeah. Here, that. So you have as you saw, you have a little uh Oh, you can Yeah, thank you. You can go uh there. So there the the the functionality is there, but it's not it's not ideal, and it's it's very it costs a lot of time to uh to use. And that's a pity, if you uh if you have uh thirty, forty minutes uh for this kind of things, and we are now with four people, but it well, imagine you are here you're with the ten people and everyone uh Yeah. Two minutes of drawing, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah yeah. Yeah, just like he said with the with the a screen which you can write, also uh a kind of voting uh mechanism. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so Uh well, just about, because uh Yeah, tomorrow? Uh, the costs are within the budget. Uh, the project is evaluated. But, before we going to celebrate, uh I have uh a little question which you can't answer, because uh there must be some kind of end report. I am busy with the end report right now. You might thinking what the hell was he doing uh Uh about all the meetings, what we have decided, a r r a report of this day. Uh, that must be made, but I don't know, here is uh standing uh whoa, we can celebrate now, but the end report is Okay well, that uh that can be done. Maybe we can do it uh together. You can see what I've uh yeah? So I I s I will uh put it on a story-board. You can see it. Because I think it will uh it must be uh Yeah, it's a three uh with seventy five uh Yeah, just about. Well, just a moment. End report. No no no, I'm just uh you can s you can read it and uh here here it is. End report. Well, this not nit it read-only. But it's not uh fully finished yet. Um, this is about the functional design, the things yeah yeah. Oh yeah. I'm uh when I said it, I remember I had it here. Marketing Expert, okay. Um about the three functions where uh which are most used and uh which must uh immediately be visible on our uh remote control. Um, it must be uh simple to use, very clear what to do, and at the younger people. So, this is really about wh uh what kind things uh must be in it and uh yeah. Yeah, I understand you, I can talk a little bit Dutch. Oka okay, okay, I I really didn't knew that. So, this one's first. You go there and you go there. So, okay. Well, maybe I can then do it one two three. If the order is in uh is is uh important, that's the word for. Uh, then the conceptual design. Uh, well all the things we have uh discussed, uh the energy, which uh turn out to be uh batteries, so that's Yeah, because yeah. Uh, he here it is still double-curve, the rubber, the flashy, the fruity, the removable. Uh, the buttons Hmm? Not double anymore. Nay but that this is what um Yeah. And the the added functions like Tetris snake, it's under the parental control, the touch-screen. So, it's uh just a summary of what uh we had discussed uh Uh, it's very cheap, you you maybe you you you you come at uh It's very necessary. Yeah, but it still has some yeah. Okay, but so we can discuss that uh we can discuss that kind of things I think with the with the the board of uh What's it what's the company called? I just keep forgetting it. Real Real Reaction. Real Reaction, yeah. Okay, so uh anybody uh misses something here about uh Yeah, okay, that's that's what I'm gonna write b between now. But, i in here nothing uh Mm-hmm. Yes. Yeah, touch-screen I've mentioned. Yeah, okay, well I gonna redesign uh something now. No. Because I think it will Oh, five minutes from to finish meeting. Oh, that's cool, Tim. Finish meeting now. Well, I'm I'm I'm going to finish my end report. I am the one who can say that. Yeah? Hereby the meeting is finished. Yeah.
J_ and J_. Evaluation. Hmm. Hmm. Interesting. Ah, okay. Cool. J_ and J_. Jane and Jane. 'Kay guys, take it away. Hmm. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Hmm. 'S l it's like an uh Easter egg. Weemote. Wait what I w got in mind. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Maybe it's an idea to sell it without a cover, so that you can pick a cover in the in the shop. Yeah, okay. Yeah, okay. Hmm. Mm. Oui okay. Yeah. An another idea. Uh, maybe we could uh develop a cover uh with wood style. They'll please the elder users as well. Yes. Not not too uh yeah. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Or blue or. Well I I I think so. Yeah, except for the buttons it's it could be a standard model. 'Kay, it's my time now. Okay. During the Oh. During the design uh design life-cycle we uh we made lot of requirements and trend analysis and stuff. Um, now is the time to uh evaluate our prototype concept to uh to the past requirements. So we are going to evaluate the design according to the past user requirements and trends analysis. Um, we're going to do that with a seven point scale. Opening a Word document now. Okay. One oh, okay, uh I have to expla explain something. We have to uh be consensive about about things. So, it has to be a group uh group decision. Okay? Uh We're going to vote. We yeah? The prototype. Yeah. Okay, one. The remote control is designed for people with age below forty. Seven is false. Yeah, b one or Most true? Yeah, so so a o one is appropriate? Or, more like a four. Three. Ah, exactly. Exactly. Three. Yeah. But also for yeah, okay. Uh, second. The remote control is beautiful. Yeah, acco according to us, it's one? Or Yeah, p s Of c of course you have to be uh very positive and uh enthusiastic about your own product. Three. Uh, the remote control looks fancy. One? Good. Four. The remote control has big, clear channel switching buttons. Daniel. Uh, teletext buttons and volume buttons? False? And volume? True. Big and clear? Hey. Hey. Hide. It's it's not yeah, it J Five? Okay. Yeah, it's it's yeah. Red. Okay. Volume. The remote control is easy to be found. Oh, okay, but 'kay, look. If you put uh your normal uh remote control under your bed, or you throw this remote control under your bed, is it better findable? A li little bit maybe? Four? Fi I Ah, I I I think five. It's it's it doesn't really make a lot of Four? Yes, but five is between four and six. B_. Yeah, it it's Yeah, yeah. But but the survey under users was that they uh really lost it. Like, no not uh not seeing it, but lost it in the house or something. But, okay. Yeah, okay. Yeah, I I agree, I agree. Okay. Eight, the remote control has fresh, fruity colours. Yeah, yeah, not too flashy. The remote control is made of soft material. Three? Easy to use? Top easy to use? It's it's not the most easy to use It can be easier. Jus just with ten buttons, that's the easiest. Yeah, but the most uh easy to use is just with one button on t Yeah, okay, but easy n not not the most easy to use, I think. Two? We also have to compare it to the uh to the remote controls on the market nowadays. So Yeah yeah, I'm uh hurrying. Okay, eleven. The remote control is innovative. A very of course. The remote control has m remova removable from Multilux. The remote control, i it has speech recognition. False. The remote control has built-in games? Yeah. And the last, paren parental advisory function. Yes, I do. Save as. Okay, I will uh do the the math. Now it's your turn. No. Advanced chip. Advanced chip is three. Three Euros, yep. Okay, one piece, yeah. No. Speech recognition, I think. No. No. Thingy. Yes, three. Eight. Okay, go on. Just go on. Two. Two. No. S Yeah, but but D but Daniel, tha that's that's another brand. That's another article to sell. That doesn't account for this. Producing this. No. Yeah. Yeah, of course. Yeah. Daniel. Daniel, what do you think about Here. What do you think about uh putting a battery in it, but also selling like uh the covers, a docking station just apart from the from the thing, so that you can uh put uh rechargeable batteries in it and just Yeah, yeah, okay. Just an idea. Yeah. Yeah, of course. Yeah. Yeah, Yeah. Hey, those ar arcs, why are there for? The blue blue uh Okay. No, no no. Yeah. But, wha 'Kay, look, what is the uh If you make it double-curved, it costs one Euro more. But No, but does it have a lot of extra uh fun function more like Yeah. Yeah, uh aesthetic. I mean, uh you make like eleven and a half Euros profit instead of twelve and a half. But I don't know if twelve and a half is uh a fixed uh fixed price. No, we can't go above that. Yeah? Yeah, okay. Then it's okay. Yeah. Yeah, I think so. Yeah. What a what about all the m the environment freaks? Not freaks, the envi No. I I think it's it's It look like this one. Yeah. Yeah. This is it. Ah no, we have to do all those hours again. Go back. One back? Costs on uh No redesign. Yeah. Yeah, okay, yeah. Hmm. I I didn't think so. That there was a lot of room for it. But, that's mainly because uh of the information that was delivered to us. It was just fixed information and get your stuff from there, and I couldn't go on on i on the internet and search my own stuff. Bu Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. Leadership was uh crappy. Okay. No, leadership was uh Okay, I thought uh the first meeting was a little bit of unstructured meeting. Uh, you could have but uh, it was your first, no uh no disrespect or something, but you could have uh structure it a l little bit more. So like, I I was talking most of the time the first meeting meeting, and Yeah. But About me. Yeah, you made up. No, it you did better. Yeah. Much more constructive. Two guys. Okay. Means. Digital pen, I thought uh th the first time I did individual work, I used it. But, a and the first two meetings I brought it with me, but I didn't use it at all after the first the first meeting. It's it's not real real use for me. Not really, no. Yeah, like when you do this. Smaller? Oh. Sorry. Okay. New ideas? Do you? Go on. Yeah. Mm, yeah, I think so. Did you heard what he said? I don't I don't know what I mean. Oh, I have some figure. Here. The eva the evaluation, the mm the mean uh number is uh one point eight one point eight six. So that's fairly uh fairly good, I think. Uh, that uh all the requirements uh are true or very true, right. Yep. Yeah. May maybe the idea you proposed is uh a screen here. And draw it, and it's it's placed over there. Hmm? No. Ah, very bad. But I think this is better than regular flip-overs, but Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but insert image isn't available? Here. Picture from scanner, clip-art. Hyperlink? Hey, what if you do like hyperlink? Type type it? Re Real Reaction dot N_L_. Yes, is now is okay. Okay? Huh. 'Kay, double-click it. You're erasing. Double-click it. Yeah. Yep. What I really miss also is uh is a d is a turtle is a decision uh decision system like um With the evaluation, you have to Polls like, what do you want, a one, a two, maybe a a l a little application like uh uh give your own number and click one two three four five six seven. Yeah, j ju ju yeah, v voting application. Just a little group group decision application. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Yeah, of course. But, uh you can still discuss about it, but but click it in an application, that's a lot easier to process. The digit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. That's it? Celebration. Yeah. Yeah. What is an end report? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Oh, you ha you have ten minutes left, I uh read. You have now ten minutes left to finish up the end report. Yeah. Um You you already made a beta version, or Pages. Okay, Daniel. Do you want a chair maybe? Hey? Oh, okay. Five minutes for finishing. Management Expert, you have to change that. Marketing. Yeah, but you can save it u the under another name. Maybe um the The Yeah. You Yeah. No, you have to put uh, switch channels uh at the top, because that's the most used function and teletext at the second Oh nay, a volume changing, second. S switch, yes. Yeah. Okay, go on. Yes, very good. Yeah. Yeah. The order. Single-curves. No, okay. Was initial, the plan. The initial plan. No, it's it's not very cheap, but that no, but it's a development inside corporation. Like, uh w we don't have to buy parental control. Our own people can make that, I think. Yeah, it it has some cost, but Yeah. Real Reaction. Okay. Still the end conclusion. That's all, I think. Yeah, but but the the decisions are put in the uh conclusion, I think. Why we decided to use a flat uh L_C_D_. Yeah. Um Save it. Hmm. Yeah, but then you had the same thing. Example of children remote. Oh wait. Wait. Hmm. That's a pity. You declare.
Evaluation. Mm-hmm. That's gonna be t problem. Yeah, well sure. Hi. Yeah, uh well, and as you saw, we would just have the basic remote with the panel L_C_D_ uh screen. Well, these would be the main buttons, h you could uh change them later on in your own profile if you want to. But, well it's standard they will be delivered with this kind of uh set-up. We have the more advanced menu uh setting right here. We have the sub-menus and stu stuff. We made a top oh, or a front view. Just so like you wanna uh back view. As you can see, this uh there, there are uh two uh weird bumps in it. This is for uh the added uh effect of uh well uh y youth and dynamic. And uh this is for the artistic effect. Well, what we figured is uh we'll show you a picture later on you have more b a better idea after that. But, idea is for to stay in balance with these two uh with these two. And so when you put it on the table, it will just lay down. It won't uh roll around or stuff. But it will lie more in your hand like an old telephone maybe, or like these old uh phones. Y you you may get the idea. So thi this is about uh how we figured it should be. The s panel we g you would hide with some more uh rubber layers, like we discussed early on. Uh, you would s you wouldn't see the uh straight panel, but more fluidly and round. Yeah. And uh, in these bumps you could actually uh put some electronics uh that would you can make a more thinner uh design, and that would actually look very nice, yeah. And uh, about the colour, what have Yeah, f uh, as colours, do you do you have the picture in uh Oh yeah. Now, well this is the idea about uh the bumps. Uh, you can see there's a v a very uh youthful uh dynamic uh exterior. It uh you just want to hold it you uh you are young and uh dynamic like us. Yeah, it's like an e but this is for children. We we want a more adult version. But, this is like a remote control for children.. A weemote. Yeah. Hey, that's actually a brilliant uh marketing stand. Uh, but So this actually basic the idea. We we just want to build a more uh adult vers adult version of of this. And and for colours, we we figured starting with basic colours like uh white or metallic grey. Those are the technological colours actually, so it d Or blue or whatever. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, maybe yeah, perhaps you're right. Uh, I I would I would actually agree with this sounds logical. Nah. Yeah. Yeah, li like like this like this. This isn't this isn't too much, is it? I f Yeah. The buttons, I Yeah, uh something like this would be nice. Okay, that's that's it from us. Uh-oh. Why? Yeah, it's not just uh designed for people under the age of forty. It's also designed for people above forty. So I have I've Yeah, two or three, because it's not just uh the qu question is aimed at is it designed for people with age below forty. But it's also designed for people of age above forty. So, I'll say it's about three. Yeah, I I think Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Leads to user face, yeah. Yeah, false. Uh, hmm. Yeah, the they are big and clear.. Yeah, but but the teletext button. Yeah, you can ch That's in a menu. So, it's w yeah, it it it it isn't entirely unclear, but So, I wouldn't give it a seven. I would give it a more a five or a six. Uh, I don I don't know. What do you think, uh Mister Project Manager? Hmm. Yeah. Yeah, it has these all these fruity colours and it has a strange shape. So, if you so if you have trouble finding it Well, then uh then I'll go for four. Because uh four is between three and uh uh also between between true and false. Uh, so I'll I'll go for four. Wha Yeah, that that's a better question actually. Well, if i if you see a strange shape lying somewhere, uh then you'd uh recognise it as, whoa, that is strange. Yeah. Yeah, what is that. Uh, so it's Yeah. Yeah, rubber, is kind of soft. Well, I don yeah, it is kind of It No. Uh It could yeah. Functional ability.. No, it's it I I'll go for two. My vote's on two. Yes. Yes, it Yeah, they are built in. Not down. You really like the parental advisory. Bu Yeah, he made it. No. Me, too. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, n no. No. Yes. No. Uh, we have one. We have one. No, sev zero. Well, that's um yeah, speech recognition and s A zero. No. No. Yeah. Just go on. Then we'll see uh we'll we'll see uh wha how much we are over budget. Zero. I don't think so. No, this is a standard colour. Yes, this is a special colour. That's an add-on. No. These three. Well, we're only four Euro over budget. But Well, other case, we can make it single-curved or uncurved. Yeah. Okay, sure. Yeah, sure. Okay, well you you can go from double-curved to single-curved. And that would solve the budget problem. Yeah. It's just yeah well, the single-curve that Yeah. Exactly, yeah. We going to cut Yeah, we just make it flat. But, you do l Function. Worth, does it have added worth? No, um Yeah, well let's assume it is. We we should assume it i that it is. But I I figured that the kinetic would be a marketing promotion. R if you uh promote a kinetic um I kinetic remote control, I mean, that would b sell better than an a normal remote control. No, well, y I mean uh, y you can go into your neighbour and tell him, ha, my k uh remote control is kinetic. You have standard old battery control uh remote con True. It is possible, but you can't use double uh curves for titanium. That's one of the functionability uh Well, I th I think you two, uh especially you and uh and uh Daniel, you d you you both had uh the less creative uh roles in the project. 'Cause I think m I think Jeroen and I, we had a more design we could have more we had more room for creativity than than you two. Ha. Nah, the leadership wasn't crappy, it was the leader that was crappy. Nah. No, the leadership was okay. Yeah, it was good. Try to learn from your mistake. And we will never do it again. Yeah, that went w it went well. It's it's just uh Nah. Yeah, we we had some trouble with the pen, but Yeah, but us Yeah. Oh. No, I have it working. But, uh yeah, well uh No, it doesn't have that much added value to the Yeah. Know what I mean. Or text function. Just t t type text, and that that would be uh excellent. Mean Oh. But uh, problem is, well you can't discuss anything well you you ca uh you can, but you will discuss a lot less than l like we did now. We I mean uh w w w one one person s maybe said three. But, well uh I we said uh, no I w th think two, because this and this, and then you can react uh on it. But if you you put a three on it, uh just figure well, everybody knows what I'm knowing, so they'll all just put a two on. Yeah, but it would yeah. Yeah okay, the for processing part. But then uh, I think the idea of one person entering it and the rest uh discussing it, that uh isn't that bad idea, actually. Not that your opinion isn't valued, but but still. Yeah, sure. Y yikes. Seventy five pages. So you you finished it actually, and so we just have to read it and say yes or no? It's not double. Uh, it's not double anymore, eh? Yeah, okay. Yeah. On thing uh One small thing uh, the added functions. Uh, was it included in the cost? I don't think so, eh? It's very cheap. Okay, um hereby is the meeting is finished.
Yo. Evaluation criteria. Oops. Some creative uh Oh. Yeah. Ok okay. Shall I give a short introduction and then uh Okay. J_ and J_, okay. Take it away. Um, this was our first concept. We decided to use a single touch-screen. So, we've worked out this concepts, how to how to hold it, where to put the buttons and and stuff. And um, well, we began with uh with a form of shape, that is uh is easy to hold w in one hand, left or right handed. So, we made i it a little bit less thick and uh it has some ar artistic meaning. No? This uh isn't nothing. Idea maybe uh is better. Um well, during the meeting I showed you the concept of uh placing the buttons on top, usable with your thumb, and uh the menu structure, uh if necessary, with your other hand, so it's just gonna hold it easily. And it has to be acce accessible with your uh other hand too, of course. So we began uh working out a concept. Yeah, the panel just uh of course goes like this. But the overlaying layer is uh a little bit uh curved and stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, we added that this um can be held with your hands for this maximum is om yeah, one and a half centimetres. So, you have room here for your battery and maybe even other um electronic chips. S and you can just be the the layer of the touchscreen and some have some wires underneath it to make it as uh thin as possible in the middle for good grip. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It would be best to to appeal to a broad public and make the covers exchangeable, so the young people will buy an orange and a red and blue and a purple, but when the o older people uh go in the shop and they see uh an orange um remote control, it would be less appealing than a white one. And young people, we think, are a little bit more flexible, they think, ah I'll buy for a couple of Euros some noi nice hip uh Well, um I think a cover is necessary, 'cause als otherwise you'll just have the L_C_D_ screen. So, there must be some cheap standard cover, um maybe white or something, that's could comes with it and you can buy, so we can make extra money. Okay. The other way around, you mean. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay, yeah. Well yeah, a colour of a wood style, a white c and uh a couple of h hip uh fruity colours. And lea uh l delivered standard with a fruity colour, but not too not too much. This is banana and mango, not not purple or p orange and yellow. Ah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, okay. No. Yeah. Okay. Okay. It's my turn. Mm. Yeah. No no, a little more in the middle. No, uh three or yeah. Yeah, it will be primary appealing to to m minus forty, but also appealing to Yeah. It's Wow. Yeah, it's the marketing uh angle on television. We have a wonderful Yeah. Well, it's also fancy then. Yeah. Of course. We have a perfect remote. Yes. Yeah yeah, oh they have to agree but I'm the User Interface uh Expert. Um, uh no. You you've different menu. And volume is impo yeah. Yeah yeah, big and clear. But you could make a teletext button uh six. Otherwise, the people who read this uh are gonna think we have no teletext button. No. Yeah. Black and red. Okay, don't forget to save it. Uh Uh well, when we put in fancy colours, yeah and Yeah. But, um it it's not making any sound uh, have we deciding? So It'll make a difference. We have the better re I don't know. Yeah, I think so. My remote control's black. A little bit, but yeah. Uh K yeah. Fo fo yeah fo five is. Yeah, okay, you're right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If your uh fifteen remotes in a drawer, uh you find it, yeah? Yeah, that's stupid. Uh, but when you lost it you're just not Yeah, mostly when you lose your remote control, it it's under your Most of times when you lose it you're sitting on it. Uh Um I would call uh choose two, 'cause we decided not to make two f uh fresh colours, as it would not. Um, kinda soft, but but not this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah yeah, easy to use, very afford. No, you can do two, because um it can be easier. But then you're l yeah, but then you'll lose function f yeah, functionality and our fancy uh look, so. But It is r it is rather easy to use, because you have the primary buttons always visible. No. Yeah, m mine too. Yeah, but waits just a minutes. Inspiration. These are the m regular remotes. Yes, true, one. Yes, one. Very multifunctional. No. This is used with speech recognition, this. Yes. But uh, maybe make it two, because the games are in a sub-menu and not uh it's not an entire game. Yeah, okay. Yes. Th did you make this or the Yeah, It changes it maybe. Oh yay. Oh dear. Hmm? If they're under twelve fifty. Yeah? Cau 'cause so it's okay. Battery, yes. One. One, yeah. Kinetic, one. Yeah. No. No, the advanced chip is uh Yeah. Yeah, you give it a sample, uh one. No. You no. Yeah, 'cause um the layer around it fits around the bubbles on the o on the uh the back of the Uh, we don't have anything else. So Could you step a little to the right ma Yeah. Oh, sorry. Or And zero. Special uh is the special colour? Mm. Yeah. Yeah, if if you're honest, we'll uh type one, special colour. Yeah. Uh, j maybe we'll finish uh the the list first and then look back, aye? No. Scroll wheel, no. No. One, yeah. No. Mm, is it No. No. So No. No. Mm, single-curves. Yeah. Just cut off the kine yeah. Or yeah. Yeah, we just put a good battery it it. Mobile phones nowadays. But you can use rechargeable batteries anyway, just you s you have to recharge them manual. Yeah, that's a cost reduc Ah. Yeah, so we have to bake the ba back flat, and then No, it's it's just one curve and not a back uh curved I think. Or Or are these two curves? Uh Yeah, but what else uh do we have to cut out? No advanced chip, uh that's a little bit of problem. Although, can we make it with a regular chip? Curvy. Explanation. Twelve fifty. Well Yeah, but does it fit with our design? Do we have to u adapt it? It's single-curves. W Could we just make the bubbles uh cut off the back, and then we're uh has Okay. More. Yeah. You make it optional. Functional. Uh, there's an a a athe aesthetic value, but not functionality. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but it doesn't fit in our co cost profile. So You ma can make an an especialised extra gold version. Yeah. Yeah, just one big curve. Uh, this uh American figures. You just cut down some trees. Whoever makes uh a remote control out of titanium. Yes. No. We sue. We Yeah, we'll start her all o all over again. Um For us, there was a lot of creativity. We could just sign up an uh remote if we liked. Uh Crappy. Cra Yeah. Yeah, example of crappy leadershi Okay, yeah. You could of said, shut up you fool. Yeah, more more consensus. Ev everybody w was agreeing every Yeah. Well, we work together on a project, but everybody has his own task. So, it is a little bit Yeah. No Well, it went okay. Stupid stupid pen, but uh Yeah, but but draw something uh difficult. D uh just write your name right now. Try to write your name, in in writing letters, of course, yeah? Yeah, normally, uh this uh the w Block letter sign it, yeah? Just just write your name in in one line. If it's a little bit too small bit quicker now. It didn't Uh he he knows how it works, yeah. Y well, yeah. Th the i The idea is great, but it doesn't work properly. Uh Yeah. Nee. As uh as I said a m a c few moments ago, it I would like, myself, to write with a normal pen, because must um Yeah, it's almost the same concept, but you can just sim more simply put it on our scanner. I it's the same concept as the pen, where you f have to download the software or s uh very uh slow. Yes. No, and it doesn't give any added value. Yeah, not user-friendly. Yeah, and it's it's not very precise. We're trying to m to Yeah, it may um Yeah, and tr try to wri write your name uh in a in a normal uh size, yeah. Smaller. Yeah, smaller. Just like when you're writing on a letter. No, a as you saw on on this drawing, just open open this one or that one. It's uh th it it Yeah, uh we had more problems even here when we trying to draw these buttons, it's almost impossible to get clear uh when you're uh And the eraser was another problem. It w t is is this large. And when you try to erase this line, y I'm gonna erase my name there. M Abo What kind of new ideas? Yeah, uh New ideas about uh the working of this software, about about the project, about the remote controls or Hello. Yeah. So true. Not really, just they have to improve it. Uh, the concept is okay, but it has to be quicker. Uh, it is still opening my programme, n almo almost uh my entire computer is locked up during the process and it, yeah, just takes too many time. People will still feel the need to to write it quickly on uh a page and not download it and save it, and More user-friendly. 'Cause when you use a pen, you can just draw like you d draw normally, and you do Yeah. Yeah, that l Would be easier. Or at least when you you don't have to adapt to the technology, just you can write in the way you normally write. And now you have to um keep constantly in mind that you're drawing on this screen. And that's a very bad concept. Nah, okay, I I it's my opinion that I Yeah, it's can be saved easier. But if you're in normal flip-over you a lot of people write text. There's no text option. And writing text uh, yeah, you've gotta really do your best to write some Yeah. Or maybe even insert picture. If you have uh some presentation, and you have some f Yeah. 'Cause then you could Oh, okay. So you can With uh W_W_ dot Google dot com. Oh yeah. Maybe. You'll just make a link in Yeah. There's one way to uh Maybe if if you're not using the eraser Something else th Yeah, arrow. Okay. Well, it's Yeah, okay. But. To use, yeah. Yeah. And that's m That's mostly the case, from the over here with the managements you get two minutes to make your case, and if you have to do all this kind You'll rather use PowerPoint and work it out in advance. And th the one or two things you have to draw when you're there, just use a flip-board. Yeah. Okay. Yo, manager. When are w When are we going to produce it? Oh. A chairman. Yes. It's a read-only version. Oh, okay. Uh One two three. Yeah. Well, okay, maybe you can add it later that we decided in the end because of the cost. A single-curved. Ah, it's very cheap. Yeah. He'll do it in his free time. So uh Of directur or directors. Yeah. You can ask your personal Yeah, the end conclusion. But uh Um, the decision to make um the buttons on the top, and the menu on the on the bottom. And clearly Yeah, touch-screen you've mentioned. Okay. Okay, this n yeah. Party party. Oh, before you change anything maybe you um save it first. You can't you can select file and export and then those J_ PEG files. Well, eight. And we have uh, another blank one. Did we change anything? Wow. Yeah. It's a new uh commercial logo. Don't save it, aye? Uh, why are only the first five SMARTboard files saved?



@highlight

Um , once again I'm uh gonna take minutes .

@highlight

Uh , first we have a prototype presentation by G_ and G_ .

@highlight

Uh evaluation crit criteria .

@highlight

Uh , in combination with the finance I um uh I received uh a an uh an Excel uh file which we have to fill in later on .

@highlight

Uh , and then we must see uh if we uh stay under the twelve and a half Euro .

@highlight

And after that , uh uh an evaluation of uh the process how we uh how we have done it here with the SMARTboard , with the with our laptops , with the all uh all this .

@highlight

Once again , forty minutes , I would g give the word to um G_ and G_ for the prototype presentation .

@highlight

Shall Yeah , well sure .

@highlight

Um , this was our first concept .

@highlight

We decided to use a single touch-screen .

@highlight

And um , well , we began with uh with a form of shape , that is uh is easy to hold w in one hand , left or right handed .

@highlight

Um well , during the meeting I showed you the concept of uh placing the buttons on top , usable with your thumb , and uh the menu structure , uh if necessary , with your other hand , Yeah , uh well , and as you saw , we would just have the basic remote with the panel L_C_D_ uh screen .

@highlight

Well , these would be the main buttons , h you could uh change them later on in your own profile if you want to .

@highlight

We have the more advanced menu uh setting right here .

@highlight

We have the sub-menus and stu stuff .

@highlight

As you can see , this uh there , there are uh two uh weird bumps in it .

@highlight

This is for uh the added uh effect of uh well uh y youth and dynamic .

@highlight

And so when you put it on the table , it will just lay down .

@highlight

The s panel we g you would hide with some more uh rubber layers , But the overlaying layer is uh a little bit uh curved and stuff .

@highlight

you can make a more thinner uh design , So , you have room here for your battery S and you can just be the the layer of the touchscreen and some have some wires underneath it to make it as uh thin as possible in the middle for good grip .

@highlight

Uh , you can see there's a v a very uh youthful uh dynamic uh exterior .

@highlight

it's like an uh Easter egg .

@highlight

Yeah , it's like an e but this is for children .

@highlight

We we want a more adult version .

@highlight

So this actually basic the idea .

@highlight

We we just want to build a more uh adult vers adult version of of this .

@highlight

And and for colours , we we figured starting with basic colours like uh white or metallic grey .

@highlight

Those are the technological colours actually , It would be best to to appeal to a broad public and make the covers exchangeable , so the young people will buy an orange and a red and blue and a purple , but when the o older people uh go in the shop and they see uh an orange um remote control , it would be less appealing than a white one .

@highlight

And young people , we think , are a little bit more flexible , they think , ah I'll buy for a couple of Euros some noi nice hip uh Maybe it's an idea to sell it without a cover , so that you can pick a cover in the in the shop .

@highlight

um I think a cover is necessary , So , there must be some cheap standard cover , Yeah , but uh you d you mustn't forget that uh our target aim is younger people .

@highlight

So I think uh it will be a better idea to have some uh flashy fruity colours as as a standard , and for the people who uh really want uh a more sophisticated , more traditional look , they're willing to pay uh that .

@highlight

Yeah .

@highlight

Yeah , maybe yeah , perhaps you're right .

@highlight

Uh , maybe we could uh develop a cover uh with wood style .

@highlight

a wood style , a white c and uh a couple of h hip uh fruity colours .

@highlight

And lea uh l delivered standard with a fruity colour , but not too not too much .

@highlight

But , the mai I think th uh the standard must be some kind of uh uh attractive flashy colours .

@highlight

Not too , but w a little , Um , now is the time to uh evaluate our prototype concept to uh to the past requirements .

@highlight

Um , we're going to do that with a seven point scale .

@highlight

We have to uh be consensive about about things .

@highlight

We're going to vote .

@highlight

The remote control is designed for people with age below forty .

@highlight

Yeah , it's not just uh designed for people under the age of forty .

@highlight

It's also designed for people above forty .

@highlight

Yeah , two or three , The remote control is beautiful .

@highlight

acco according to us , it's one ?

@highlight

Or Of c of course you have to be uh very positive and uh enthusiastic about your own product .

@highlight

Uh , the remote control looks fancy .

@highlight

One ?

@highlight

The remote control has big , clear channel switching buttons .

@highlight

Yeah yeah , Uh , teletext buttons and volume buttons ?

@highlight

Teletext is in the menu .

@highlight

Volume is true .

@highlight

Yeah , the they are big and clear .

@highlight

.

@highlight

I would give it a more a five or a six .

@highlight

The remote control is easy to be found .

@highlight

Uh well , when we put in fancy colours , yeah Yeah , it has these all these fruity colours and it has a strange shape .

@highlight

If you put uh your normal uh remote control under your bed , or you throw this remote control under your bed , is it better findable ?

@highlight

It'll make a difference .

@highlight

Well , we p we can do it glow in the dark .

@highlight

Because uh four is between three and uh uh also between between true and false .

@highlight

uh , w uh according to uh the the other uh remote controls , there may uh uh be there in your uh T_V_ room , this one will stand out , I think .

@highlight

if this lying on your couch , you're you're you think what's that for kinda orange uh thing .

@highlight

If your uh fifteen remotes in a drawer , uh you find it , yeah ?

@highlight

But but the survey under users was that they uh really lost it .

@highlight

Yeah , that's stupid .

@highlight

Most of times when you lose it you're sitting on it .

@highlight

Uh the remote control has fresh , fruity colours .

@highlight

Um I would call uh choose two , 'cause we decided not to make two f uh fresh colours , as it would not .

@highlight

Yeah , yeah , not too flashy .

@highlight

The remote control is made of soft material .

@highlight

Yeah , rubber , is kind of soft .

@highlight

Yeah , but not too soft we have decided .

@highlight

Three , yeah .

@highlight

Easy to use .

@highlight

One .

@highlight

It's it's not the most easy to use Jus just with ten buttons , that's the easiest .

@highlight

Yeah , but the most uh easy to use is just with one button It is r it is rather easy to use , because you have the primary buttons always visible .

@highlight

Okay , two .

@highlight

Yeah , two .

@highlight

The remote control is innovative .

@highlight

The remote control has m remova removable from Multilux .

@highlight

The remote control has built-in games ?

@highlight

But uh , maybe make it two , because the games are in a sub-menu and not uh it's not an entire game .

@highlight

Yeah , but they are built in , so it's one .

@highlight

The remote control , i it has speech recognition .

@highlight

False .

@highlight

And the last , paren parental advisory function .

@highlight

Okay , we have now to c uh to calculate the production cost .

@highlight

Yeah , if the costs are under twelve and a half Euro , uh then we uh can uh ra uh move on to the project evaluation , as we have uh experienced it .

@highlight

Otherwise , we have uh do uh have to do a little uh redesign uh thingy .

@highlight

So Kinetic , one .

@highlight

Battery , yes .

@highlight

One .

@highlight

Advanced chip .

@highlight

So it's only uh once double-curved .

@highlight

We're now in a problem , 'cause uh we have uh reached eleven Euro yet .

@highlight

Then we'll see uh we'll we'll see uh wha how much we are over budget .

@highlight

Special uh is the special colour ?

@highlight

Yeah , but we want to make uh the wood colours , uh that uh No , this is a standard colour .

@highlight

Yes , this is a special colour .

@highlight

Yeah , if if you're honest , we'll uh type one , special colour .

@highlight

Yeah , but but D but Daniel , tha that's that's another brand .

@highlight

That's another article Well , we're only four Euro over budget .

@highlight

Well , other case , we can make it single-curved or uncurved .

@highlight

Mm , single-curves .

@highlight

The kinetic thing , can we just skip it , because uh you have to shake it , but that's not really innovative .

@highlight

What do you think about uh putting a battery in it , but also selling like uh the covers , a docking station But you can use rechargeable batteries anyway , just you s you have to recharge them manual .

@highlight

well you you can go from double-curved to single-curved .

@highlight

so we have to bake the ba back flat , and then No , it's it's just one curve and not a back uh curved I think .

@highlight

Or but uh it's its' well it's it's r it is the main point of the the the the look .

@highlight

No advanced chip , uh that's a little bit of problem .

@highlight

So , if we do this , uh we're on uh twelve and a half Euro .

@highlight

If you make it double-curved , it costs one Euro more .

@highlight

Uh , there's an a a athe aesthetic value , but not functionality .

@highlight

But I don't know if twelve and a half is uh a fixed uh fixed price .

@highlight

Yeah , well let's assume it is .

@highlight

But I I figured that the kinetic would be a marketing promotion .

@highlight

No , well , y I mean uh , y you can go into your neighbour and tell him , ha , my k uh remote control is kinetic .

@highlight

Yeah , but it doesn't fit in our co cost profile .

@highlight

So because if you want to go to kinetic , you're uh you're on thirteen and a half and you must go to flat , and I think now it's it's more of uh a compromise Well , we were above , so we did a little redesign now uh it's about time to uh talk about uh this project .

@highlight

was there room for creativity in our meetings or in your individual meetings ?

@highlight

But , that's mainly because uh of the information that was delivered to us .

@highlight

I I didn't think so .

@highlight

That there was a lot of room for it .

@highlight

and I couldn't go on on i on the internet and search my own stuff .

@highlight

Bu Well , I th I think you two , uh especially you and uh and uh Daniel , you d you you both had uh the less creative uh roles in the project .

@highlight

I think Jeroen and I , we had a more design we could have more we had more room for creativity than than you two .

@highlight

Uh how about the leadership ?

@highlight

I thought uh the first meeting was a little bit of unstructured meeting .

@highlight

but you could have uh structure it a l little bit more .

@highlight

So like , I I was talking most of the time the first meeting meeting , and I was a I was also very uh unhappy , uh very unsatisfied uh about the and uh I think the the last two meetings uh also we we reached uh some good decisions about uh talk Yeah , more more consensus .

@highlight

No , it you did better .

@highlight

Uh , teamwork ?

@highlight

Well , we work together on a project , but everybody has his own task .

@highlight

and it's wo more like presentation and some points were discussed .

@highlight

Nah .

@highlight

Yeah , we we had some trouble with the pen , but D uh just write your name right now .

@highlight

Uh he he knows how it works , yeah .

@highlight

The idea is great , but it doesn't work properly .

@highlight

Uh It's it's not real real use for me .

@highlight

I it's the same concept as the pen , where you f have to download the software or s uh very uh slow .

@highlight

Be it it takes a lot of time to draw things and to write things , And the eraser was another problem .

@highlight

M Abo What kind of new ideas ?

@highlight

Well , the the idea of the touch-screen is uh New ideas about uh the working of this software , about about the project , about the remote controls or I don't know what what I mean .

@highlight

the mm the mean uh number is uh one point eight one point eight six .

@highlight

So that's fairly uh fairly good , I think .

@highlight

all the requirements uh are true or very true , right .

@highlight

Yep .

@highlight

People will still feel the need to to write it quickly on uh a page and not download it and save it , and You had expected it to to be uh more more uh More user-friendly .

@highlight

And now you have to um keep constantly in mind that you're drawing on this screen .

@highlight

And writing text uh , yeah , you've gotta really do your best to write some Just t t type text , and that that would be uh excellent .

@highlight

Here .

@highlight

Picture from scanner , clip-art .

@highlight

But not the the the the predefined uh squares I think uh So there the the the functionality is there , but it's not it's not ideal , it costs a lot of time to uh To use , yeah .

@highlight

Uh , the costs are within the budget .

@highlight

Uh , the project is evaluated .

@highlight

because uh there must be some kind of end report .

@highlight

Uh about all the meetings , what we have decided , here is uh standing uh whoa , we can celebrate now , but the end report is You have now ten minutes left to finish up the end report .

@highlight

Maybe we can do it uh together .

@highlight

So I I s I will uh put it on a story-board .

@highlight

Um , this is about the functional design , but you can save it u the under another name .

@highlight

It's a read-only version .

@highlight

about the three functions where uh which are most used and uh which must uh immediately be visible on our uh remote control .

@highlight

Um , it must be uh simple to use , very clear what to do , and at the younger people .

@highlight

No , you have to put uh , switch channels uh at the top , because that's the most used function and teletext at the second a volume changing , second .

@highlight

S switch , yes .

@highlight

then the conceptual design .

@highlight

Well , okay , maybe you can add it later that we decided in the end because of the cost .

@highlight

Uh , he here it is still double-curve , the rubber , the flashy , the fruity , the removable .

@highlight

It's not double .

@highlight

Nay but that this is what um Was initial , the plan .

@highlight

The initial plan .

@highlight

And the the added functions like Tetris snake , the added functions .

@highlight

Uh , was it included in the cost ?

@highlight

I don't think so , eh ?

@highlight

Okay , so uh anybody uh misses something here about uh Yeah , the end conclusion .

@highlight

that's that's what I'm gonna write b between now .

@highlight

Yeah , but but the the decisions are put in the uh conclusion , I think .

@highlight

well I gonna redesign uh something now .

@highlight

Oh , before you change anything maybe you um save it first .

@highlight

Finish meeting now .

@highlight

I'm going to finish my end report .
