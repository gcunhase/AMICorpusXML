Uh fourth meeting. Some extra deciding. Well I'll show you the notes again. Very interesting. Well you'll you two will uh present us your prototype. Then um I guess that's your bit? I I didn't s see anything about it, so I already uh thought you uh you were to do that. So the you're uh. I'll show you how we're going to do with financing this uh design. And then we'll evaluate, after after we have redesigned it. Because uh well we'll see about the costs. Um we'll uh evaluate our p our uh production and then uh we can close. Well the finance uh we'll do later, so um firstly uh I'll show you the notes. I don't think it's very interesting. Oh nei. Uh no. Alright. This is copy paste. So Of course. You had some very strange layout. Well um We ge we went through the agenda, and well we had some uh some presentations from you three. And uh I summarised what you said to us. So uh I don't think it's very interesting and go through it again. So uh This is what we decided. It's also copy paste from what we made together. So we still know that. And then uh we can we can uh use the time better. Well uh next you two will uh present uh the pot prototype for us. Yeah. Correct. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah, alright. Okay. Yeah. Alright. Mm-hmm. Alright. So 'Kay. Well if I look at it, the side the side view Oh yeah alright. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. Okay. W Well I see, but Well. Yeah I see it. Yes. When I look at uh when I look at this side view, I think w when I have that in my hand, it's terrible. If if you look if if this this is thick, and this is thin, th th then it that it lies over your hands. But Well what what what I what I agree is that when uh when um you have such of uh an arc in the middle, so that the the a the ends and the fronts is a bit thicker, so th then it falls over your hands. And how large is it? Well uh Well the sides I haven't seen yet, uh? They the the the the the side view, we didn't uh Yeah. No no no. Yep. Okay. Yeah well uh I think uh if you t if you three uh agree then then that's it. Yes. So uh I c I c Well, we'll we we'll do it like this. Alright, if you think that that's the way it should No No, when I I my personal taste is that I want it to fall over my hands with a thick But In the market uh No not totally. For me, I I wouldn't buy it. Let's say it like that. No Yes but Yeah, we don't know, but that's uh that's that's that's more market research. So let it be like this at uh at this moment. Okay? No, I think it's great. Comes to that later. Um you. Uh c You can uh Walter. You can do the evaluation uh criteria on this? That's more useful than just speaking. Yes. Mm-hmm. 'Kay. Yeah, we're we're not quite uh objective about this. To the customers? To potential customers who have to take this questionnaire? Nei. Oh no. I know, I know, I know. But um Well we can go, uh because of the time, uh pretty quick through this. Uh do we find it good-looking? Well we think so. Uh Yeah. Well, one. Well so it's point four. Easy to find t Two. No. I totally agree. We we have to get get on, go through this. No, not false. It's one. Well uh two? Y Well we have to go through it. Yep. Two. Well, no. We didn't implement anything about that. Well six then. Are the functions easy to learn? Well w I we do want we have a l f f less of an And the device R_S_I_ sensitive? Yeah. Ah. Yeah, but just do some We we I th I th I think this is too time consuming. Uh not not towards you, but towards this all. Th this is We you have to put it to the customers. Uh well well a bit, so four. Yes. One. And features included also one. And One. Uh those uh nine uh is the fancy-looking. Uh we still think so. Device fancy feeling. Yeah, cool man. Are there enough technology? Yeah well also we have two. Is the device easy to use? Yes we have not many buttons. Two, three. Are the trends about fruit and vegetables implemented? Well in our covers, in our fronts. So yes, one. Is the material attractive? Oh okay. Okay. Is the material attractive? Well the titanium is strong, and uh the rest f uh the buttons feel soft. So I would say at least two. Okay. Well Yeah. Yes, but we we have to design much more, because there was some irritating account manager coming to me. Um Oh. Uh Yes. Well, look at the costs at this point. I had to fit it in. I twelve and a half. So Well what costs a lot? The sample spea costs four. The sample speaker, the s sensor. Kick it out. We have to go to twelve and a half. The speaker costs far, by far the most. It it isn't worth it. We could make two different versions, one with and one without. But for this So, zero. Then we go to fourteen point six. Well the titanium I don't want to lose actually. L_C_ three? Yeah hand dynamo? Y t come on, w a remote control has a battery. Well be for the L_C_D_ uh you had said. Well what what's the difference between simple and regular? What's the difference between a simple and a regular chip? And simple? Nothing. Well? Your part. What happens if we do How much do we win? One. Yeah. Well, we could say, well this special colour, that isn't that that isn't there, because the the fronts they will buy it. The special colour. Yeah, then you s then you only have one half left. Uh yeah. Yeah. Yeah? No, the advanced chip is needed to have an L_C_D_ display. Says, his Uh that was in the second meeting, I think. Well I I did single curve to Well you said s double curved, uh he, because uh I thought it's a b a bit cheaper already. We can also make it flat. But Curved? Yes, that's curved. Yes. No, it's one curve. One curve, simple. We have a big financial problem. Well, then we have two dollars less profit. Come on, if we if we if we make this fifty million, they won't hesitate to uh congratulate us, so uh By the way, we also have this one. Oh, costs nothing. That's nice. Plastic is Yes, but I just got it. Who? You want to dump the titanium? And make all plastic, then we ha then we're there. Th then you have a ugly, stupid, l ugly looking, dumb remote that that no-one would buy. No, I don't think so. Yes. And the feel, and th that it is strong, and We still we had to focus to get more people from the younger group, but not lose the one Why can't I I'll put in the report we that we think that fourteen point one is the l m lowest price you can make a remote for that's trendy d these days. I I'll talk to the managers. Titanium, I thi I think this this is this is e really good re remote. But Ah those those account managers, what do th d what do they know? Come on. Riot. Yes, yes. One and a half Euros. Hmm? So? Well, no it's just uh all plastic. Well alright. Huh. Four. So But then we can add the special colour? As we have money over uh left. And we still have money left. What do we want, guys? Yes. Y Oh no. Alright. Safe. So alright. Finance? Well, guys? Guys? We have to dump our titanium, and we'll hate the managers for that, but now we're going to evaluate our project, of uh project, project. Well, satisfaction on for example, are we satisfactory about our creativity? I think it's terrible that we got uh those costs at the last moment. That's really bad. But that that that's that, yeah that's a reason, but also for our creativity. We had um nice design, and then you get the cost, and you had to dump all your creativity. Yeah. Well, alright. Uh leadership next. Uh teamwork? Uh yeah well I think so also. I al I I've uh filled that in in a the questionnaires uh each time, so Well the managers were terrible. So, with their all their useless requirements. But o alright, the teamwork? No they said, oh we won't d uh we won't uh use teletext, uh we won't use the D_V_D_. Alright, teamwork? Well great I think. Uh well what do you, what did you think about the SMARTboard? Well It's also a It's both the SMARTboards. I liked this SMARTboard, but I hated that one. Well it's both a SMARTboard. No. It's both a SMARTboard, but this one is used for a desktop, and that one is used to to draw. Well, wi w which one did you like? That one. Yeah. Yes. Th that is so. We're now talking about the SMARTboards. Or install a laptop to a beamer, or have this one standing here in an I I like it. Okay, alright. Yeah. Yeah, it is. So And uh the digi the digital pen? Did uh did you like that one? I used it uh just to check it out, but uh You you can't send that to anyone, because you you've scrabbled something on a page for yourself, and then you're going to send it, yeah. Well, no. It's, no, it it's useless. Yes. For drawings, yes. But But for notes, it i you you have to put that in a strict Uh you have to put a name, standard date, and all those things. And notes uh for a meeting are very strict. So if you uh were to write them down for yourself, and then put that in your computer, you still have to type it over to Word. So it doesn't d doesn't have any Yep. Alright. Um etcetera? Well uh the laptops? Of course great. Yeah. You can. B by my Yeah. Other uh things we used here? I hated the cameras, I hated the microphones. But No No. No. I haven't looked w one time directly at the camera. I don't care about it. Well w why not? Uh etcetera We N new ideas found? What kind of ideas for n a future schedule What? For future um meetings you have got? Chatting and emailing. Well, new ideas found by this. Not. Nothing. We don't want this. We hate this. Digital pen is useless. So Yeah, for drawings. But uh two t But uh th then you have to have a lot of drawings, because if I had a company and I'm going to uh buy those expensive huge expensive uh things, I and I have to w pay those uh papers uh that are expensive, I'm not going to uh Well th then still they they they should have a a nice graphics programme on the laptop. Because this is huge uh this v very very uh expensive paper. Yeah. Well no. I hated to draw like that. You you can't draw anything uh neat. I if it if it would be perfect following. Well th th then still it's it's it's very expensive uh towards a a just a green uh school board. Yep. Yeah yeah. Yep. Yeah. Well, they are now. It is. So, congratulations crew. Se Finally my beer. Well, that's it I think. Um I don't know how long we still have. I dunno how long uh we had for this last meeting. But uh Well yeah, it is a bit uh Well we still have to make the end report and uh all those things. I have to do that. I Di did you um save this one in the folder? Can you do that? I don't know what you have to do. Yeah. Oh it worked. Two times quick. Cool. This is nice. Uh D design. S Oh. He saved them all ten. Well alright. Um Yeah. Well Where is this? I also think so. She already knows. She? Big brother. Our manager. Yeah. I don't think so. Alright. We put the fashion in electronics, but we couldn't because of the costs. That that's the title of our uh end document. We couldn't put the fashion into the electronics. Yeah, that's a nice title. Oh. Well I'm going to resign after this project anyway, so
We have to do what? Oh. Mm. Bit late. I think it is. Alright. No you go and I'll uh supplement you. Yeah. Yeah, it's a double R_, but It's a double R_. But it's very difficult to to draw that in Yeah. Oval yeah. Channel up and volume? Yeah. Menu for the L_C_D_ screen. Well, at the back Yeah. No the back. With the logo and our uh l uh No I don't think And the And about the side view um This the front won't be as thick, but again th the the drawing technique makes it very difficult to to really uh Well, it won't be visible. Mm? Yeah. If y If you handle a remote, you you usually don't have your hand straight like this. You you have it a bit uh Yeah. Yeah. Well, they lay there all the time. Yeah yeah. Yeah you you don't you don't grab it, you you Yeah. Hmm. That way, it it falls into your hand. I think. No but but Well f for as far as I can see, three of us agree and only Nils But you're the Project Manager, you can make the hard decisions. Yeah? Mm. But what about the redesigning? Okay. Hmm. Mm. Well we designed it to be good-looking. Hmm. Yeah. We designed it to be good-looking, so Hmm. I think we shouldn't discuss any points points that long, because I don't know how how many points there are but uh Yeah. Yeah. Um, no it's uh With two huge buttons. Well it's easier to find than a a normal black one or something, because of the colour. But We have so few functions, so Yeah. Well, I should I think two, because the voice recorder is n not self learning. Yeah. Yeah. The Two two. T Yeah. One or two, another two. Well three. Mm. Yeah. This is the last meeting? Yeah. Yeah. The what? Oh. Um Well well why why why should we use a advanced chip? Yeah? Can't we do that with a regular chip? Why not? Yeah. Regular is normal. Simple. Elementary. We we we Why? We have very little options furthermore, for the Uh well we have to put that in. Nah. Yeah, you must change the chip uh back. You must change the chip back, Nils. Hmm. No we oh You you we have an advanced chip-on-print, and we have an L_C_ display. I think that's a bit double. Y we don't need both. Says. I?? One curve. Well we make it more expensive to buy. Yeah or we could replace it Why why don't we replace the titanium with uh plastic coloured titanium, uh titanium-coloured plastic? Yeah well if we uh we we have to get cheaper. But then we we've got to uh run through the eval evaluation process again. Ah no no. It's not ugly looking. The looks remain the same. Well, I do think so. feel. Yeah alright but then we we won't get there. We can dump the special colour. We l we use plastic. And plastic is already in colour I think. No, nothing. Amen. Yeah. Yeah. But No no no no. W Titanium stays there. Well No because we did not know anything about it. Yeah, but then we've got money left. Yeah. Yeah. W Well I think uh the case is double curved then. Because you y have that curve and you have that curve. Yeah well uh Well y we have curves in all directions. I mean, this this ain't titanium, but it looks like it. Pro project. Yeah. Yeah. And uh unrealistic. Well we we we used our creativity, but we just had to adapt it to the costs. Nei. Uh no. Terrible. Leadership? Well Yeah. Yeah. Right yeah. No, that's a SMARTboard, and that's a digital pen. Or not? Oh they're both SMARTboards. Yeah. But I I think this is meant by the digital pen. Yeah. Well we we used that one, and we needed it. I think. Yeah alright, but Yeah I like that one, but that one is terrible. Well I I drew this. Mm. And I made a mistake. But it it would have been uh useful, if I I could show this on the screen. Yeah for drawings. N notes mm. Mm. Yeah. But then uh it's really useful, I think. Yeah. Hmm. Thanks Project Manager. Well I did. Well I missed uh the option to uh to email, yeah. Email or chat or something. Yeah alright, but that's one n new idea. Yeah. No it isn't. Yeah. So it isn't useless. Yeah. Well you you can't you can't draw on a laptop like you like you paint of or draw with your hand. With the mouse it is No. Uh indeed. Yeah, but but then you can uh save it in instantly, and and and re-use it, and uh Hmm. Hmm. Celebration. Yeah, we can go to the bar and uh with our newly earned money. Yeah. Oh. No. No no no no. But Nils you've got some work left. I have to go to a physiotherapy. Wow. Yeah. It is handy. Well they they wanted everything we produced, so My big bird. I think you have we have to make clear to her that we are ready. Close your laptop. So she can see we're ready. Yeah. Let's take this remote into uh production. She's on the move.
Yeah. Okay. Mm right. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, I agree. It depends on the size. If it's kinda small, this is is great. But if it's it's larger, then you want to grab it. Yeah, that's the question. Yeah, I agree with the L_C_D_ screen. You have it in your palm like this, and you can watch uh watch the screen. And if you have it li in the middle, your hand might be over it. Like you're holding your telephone. Because if you have a screen on it, you wanna look at your screen. Yeah, I agree on this. No, I don't think so. That's not uh the point And you might be uh You might be target customer. Yeah. Alright. Great. Well, this is just a short intro. I'm going to do uh the ev evaluation. That's gonna be done at the end of seven point skill criteria. So I made a I made a few questions on the hand of uh uh the impor most important requirements and trends. And we have to look if our uh if our device uh is working correctly. Well, I put some questions in a Word file. See if I can find them. Uh uh uh uh mm. Well I uh think you have all seen uh this kind of evaluation, so uh I don't have to explain it. Uh the first question is, uh is the device good-looking? Because normal p uh most people thought that um earlier devices were ugly ugly. Seventy five percent of them. So what do we think? Yeah No, I know, but I have to uh evaluate it. So I have to take this questionnaire. Yeah Yeah, but I can't can s Yeah, but uh, you know We dis we di we designed it to be perfect. So But we have to be critic critical about it. And I have to uh take all these points and get a average at the end. So we we know where we stand. 'Cause th there are some things we might have uh bi might have forgotten. Right, so Right. Uh is it good-looking? The titanium might be uh f for older people. It you put uh put a black front on it or something. Right. Right. Right, a number please. So the last one is seven. Easy to change channels? Oh, sorry. Yeah, right. Change channels? Right. The power, channel and volume buttons are easy accessible? Two? Alright. The uh device is easy to find if you lose it? Yeah. Six? Right. Yeah, I agree. Yeah. Alright. Two? Yeah Yeah, I agree. No. Yeah. Right, R_ R_S_I_ sensitive? R_S_I_ sensitive? Four. Um Yeah. Right. Yeah, that's great. Well, with the uh Three. Nah f four I think. If you look at this No. Three, alright. Yeah, that's true. But Right. The average will uh come later. It has to go to twelve, right? Twelve and a half. Out. That's easy. Kick it out. Yeah. The speaker. That's some wrong info, man. No. It's uh It's just extra. Kick it out. What more? Batteries are uh quite Uh no, no no no. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah, we need to have the the L_C_D_ screen. No Yeah, but No, that's n It's not relevant. Yeah. No, Then the whole concept is uh You You can make you can make it cheaper. But if you don't sell No no no no. If if you make people brand-aware, they are willing to pay more. But Because we we use a brand at the front and uh I dun at the back. If you have uh lots of uh marketing people might buy. If you if you make it cool to have Oh, that's just great. Oh, alright. That is pretty stupid. Y Yeah, I agree. I don't think you should dump the L_C_D_ screen. Or you shou It's Or change the titanium or dump the L_C_D_ screen. But I think you could better change uh titanium to hard a hard kind of plastic looking like titanium than lose the L_C_D_ screen. Because you have lots of functions in it too. Yeah, I agree. Osl If you don't have the money, you can't make it. So s If you don't have the money, you can't make it. So this is too expensive. So we have to make it cheaper. Right. It's just free, man. Yeah right. I want chrome. Well, th that that is the problem. Yeah. Shoot. Yeah. Yeah, me too. Right. Leadership. Well it's It was very democratic. Yeah yeah. Well Yeah, think so too. Yeah, I don't like it. Yeah? This this this isn't a SMARTboard, right? Yeah right. B but you This is just a large t large television. You u you use the Yeah, but you ca This is just a beamer function. And here, on this one, you can uh draw the pictures and things like that. But That one. That one isn't accurate. It just doesn't work. You can Yeah, but I think there's a big distinction between the these th I don't need a SMARTboard. Yeah, but give me a beamer. That's uh that's much uh much cheaper. Right. Yeah. I agree. No. Yeah. Yeah. It isn't practical. Right. Your notepad. Yeah. Yeah, it might be useful for drawings. I I agree on that. Yeah, right. That Stefan use. No, I don't think so. It's it's only useful if you have to draw something. Yeah. Yeah, great. Yeah. Wireless uh wireless things. Well these chairs, man. Really great. Communicate in between. Yeah, right. Yeah. Yeah, I agree. Well, more more information in the beginning. That's For people who uh sketch th the whole day, I can imagine that it's useful. Well Yeah, I agree. Mouse is ju just isn't working if you're sketching. Yeah, but he's saying if it is correct, and you can draw very, yeah, very precise Yeah, mu It saves time. Celebration. Well Yeah. You better get started. Huh. Oh, alright. Oh great, man. I'm gonna buy one buy one for my bedroom. Maybe you are broken. You know. I think she's listening. I feel watched. Yeah. Do that. Yeah. Very catching. I'm sure management would like that. Oh, that's just great.
W what? Alri alright. We'll see. Yeah. Yeah, that's important too. Yeah. Alright. From me of course, yeah. Well from us all, yeah, from all of us. Yeah. It's a nice chorus, yeah. Repeat it yeah. Alright. Alright, we both uh will? Or one of us will? Uh Alright. If I make mistakes uh you'll uh Right. Uh well this is our design. Uh it's pretty uh much uh like uh Mike draw uh drew uh the in the during the last meeting. With uh the different uh perspectives of it. Uh we'll begin uh with the front. We have of course uh the the round shape uh the round uh basic shape. Um with uh the upper part being the front. Th So there's this part um which is made of hard plastic, the front. And uh we're we're using different colours. Of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours, and later we'll put out uh more interesting covers with different patterns and pictures and everything. But basically, different colours, bright colours not black, too dark. Fancy colours. Um then we have uh the lower part of the of the device. Uh which is of course um part of the back actually, because it's also titanium. You can see it also on the on the on the side view, that only this part is the front, and the rest of it, the under uh the under side uh of it, yeah, the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium, and has the titanium colour of course, the look. Um then we have uh on back on the front uh the logo in the upper corner, uh which is uh made uh which is also part of the back, part of the titanium uh titanium part. Yeah? It's a double R_. Yeah the logo Uh uh it's difficult to draw so small, but it's our double R_ uh logo is in there. Um so that's the logo in the upper lef uh right corner. Then we have the buttons. Uh it's difficult to draw again the little oval or round I think oval will be better for the for the d for the different uh channel buttons. So uh oval, n those are here. And then we have the m The m Yeah the the con the the the, yeah, the t volume and the channel controls uh in the middle here. Um um with kind of arrow shapes, which makes it also a bit more exciting than basic round or um uh uh square buttons. And also here are the two uh buttons we agreed on. We have the Okay button. Oh nei we uh the Okay button's here in the middle of the of the operators, of the channel and uh volume um changers. And then we've here the Menu button and the And the video button. The Yeah. And of course this low part, this is the L_C_D_ screen. Uh this is what we made of it. You can make uh suggestions uh if you want. Maybe we maybe we should finish first uh our talk and then you can add suggestions. Maybe I I don't want to I don't want to suppress you but n I'll uh finish this uh quick. Um okay I've had everything I guess on the front? Yeah the back. Yeah. We thought about Yeah, uh the back is of course totally titanium. And we thought about the logo big in the middle. Just so again the double R_. We have then the logo on front and on the back. Maybe that's too much but you have to say uh say that if you think that way. And the company slogan, we thought in a kind of arc shape uh above the logo. That's basically what we were thinking about, and Oh and uh before I forget. Yeah the the voice, of course, the voice recorder is uh at the bottom. And you can record it uh using, yeah, the the the back of the f w device. Why? Well it fits uh it it it it fits the hand, mean uh the the the the In the middle in the That's the question. Uh well Yeah. H What do you suggest I mean we do? This was Mike's prototype, and y you seemed to agreed on it. But now you have a totally different. The size? Yeah well the size doesn't really matter w I mean Side? Uh oh the side? W we we he drew the s the side, but you d you weren't paying attention as usual. Well any case, we'll discuss it now. Uh I think uh this is a pretty good uh good idea. But you you hold it like this. You're not holding it like this or something. You, yeah, y How do you call it? Yeah. Well y y y you don't have it like this. You have it more like this. You you you're using buttons this way, or if you're right-handed, this way. So you Yeah. So Yeah well And maybe you can you can grab it a bit higher, so Well Well the the Well that's a reason to to to put the L_C_D_ screen uh of course on the upper side, but If necessary. But uh are d Can you live with it? Uh Y Yeah, y y y y you said it was totally uh unusable. But do you But d you don't think this is completely unusable I guess. I think. Not totally, well Yeah but of course y you are also human. We have to take uh every everyone into account. So Yeah. Well uh who who else thinks like you? We don't know. Maybe a thousand people, or a million people. Let it be. Alright. So that's that. Uh any other suggestions? You're very personal again. Well d we designed it, so of course we are very Yeah. So and we ha we have answer now? Yeah. I Yeah, I think it Well l well let's start with the beginning, just one by one. Well, I guess uh I think uh it's uh it's it's um pointed towards the youth of course, uh if you look at the design and and the colours and everything. That was our target audience of course. But it's also not completely um uh u unacceptable for older people I guess. Uh it's it's not f a device that Yeah, that's that's uh for older people, it's it's more that classical look. So Uh no. I think Yeah they like black of course, but I think they'll uh they they think uh the the titanium look of it is also Uh I think it's also good for them, so I think we both uh have uh consider considered uh the youth and also a bit older people. So I think it's very good-looking and not only for youth uh young people. Yeah, the fourteen yeah. Is it easy to t change channels? Yeah well I think so. I think it's uh as easy as uh can be made. Uh So I Yeah. You How can you make it any easier? Yeah, huge is a Yeah. D we d we don't we don't have uh that s Yeah. Well we don't have the device that beeps uh when you lost it or so, but um um Yeah. Yeah. Mm? Are we take too much time? Yeah, very much. One. Yeah. And I think fancy-feeling too, because of the titanium back. Yeah. So well maybe two because of the voice recorder. F Yeah. One or two. Yeah. Four? Well, it doesn't really resemble any fruit, uh that's true. But but we have the the the the the sparkly fruity colours of course. And you can also have front with uh with fruit on it. I knew things uh were going uh too smoothly. There had to be some kind of trouble along the way. My god. The what? The Yeah w tha that's uh that's a bit an optional option. No. No, d th No. Yeah. No. N Uh well we have a bit of a problem I think. Because uh the L_C_D_ screen. Yeah. No. Because uh that uh y because my information says it. Huh? Uh well yeah I I read something about it, but Yeah, I I read something about it, but it wasn't very clear. I d I didn't in include it in my report. Single Well you have to use a chip. So Well you have to use the advanced chip, if you have the L_C_D_ screen. But if you have a regular chip, you can't have the L_C_D_ screen. That that's a fact. Uh Yeah, but it's only one half. Uh it d it doesn't But we d Then we have to lose the L_C_D_ screen. Yeah, I know but that's what my information says. I di I didn't uh put uh the advanced chip in there for fun. You have to use it. For the L_C_D_ screen. Yeah. Yeah. Well uh and what do they mean with curves uh again? Because we you have uncurved Yeah. Well But what what did what do n Sorry, but What do they mean with the curves? Is th Is this a curve? One curve? Yeah, this is actually two curves, yeah. It's how you It's how you look at it. Well then we have a huge problem I think. W t we can never get uh below the twelve and a half. But uh I Hey but uh I think you'll agree that uh that we that now we have this uh screen, it's it's very uh not practical to ha to consider this after we have designed the entire thing. Well that's pretty uh l N not very practical. Well But I'm n I don't agree. I think I think the titanium just uh provided the the tough look and the and the And also the the older people will like it because of that. And because i Alright it's not our target audience, but it's it's useful if it's uh important for old people. Yeah. I think the titanium is very important. Yeah we have a problem, yeah. W But you can better, yeah, dump the L_C_D_ screen then. Well what else? W I mean uh Yeah. Yeah, well yeah. Alright. I agree with that. So we u we use uh Unfortunately. Um. Titanium-coloured plastic. So titanium-coloured plastic for the back. Yeah this is good, but it it's not good enough. So we have to use the ditch the titanium, I'm afraid. What do we Well what do we know? All we want is a is a fancy design but we don't really consider the costs. So Yeah al alright, yeah. But we have to deal with it now. So So Titanium gone and add plastic. And on plastic times two and then we uh are there? No No yeah well Oh six. A lot of plastic, yeah. No two for the to make it clear. I want gold plating. No no um We have we have to uh fill W we ha No no no, but th that's not f um Well you can you can double curve, if you don't have titanium. And that we dropped, so it it can be done. But it's pretty funny. We we do want to reach twelve point five. But it isn't bad to to to stay at eleven. We get more salary, if we make if cheaper than twelve uh twelve and a half. Objection. Well I can't get no satisfaction, but uh I think it's uh Well in in if we consider the costs then this is the best, yeah. Its it's uh ridiculous actually, but Which isn't very practical, but that's the way. Uh-huh. Well uh they they didn't think of the requirements. It's the requirements of the user, uh I guess. Yeah. Yeah but they base that on on the user specifications. It was a complete disaster. No Uh it it it uh it is uh No it's other way around. That's the SMARTboard. That's the digital panel. That's that's the smart A televi Yeah. Yeah. Left or right? Well I didn't use uh Nei It it's much m But uh you can uh I I sent it about three times now. Uh a green uh board with uh chalk is much more useful than that thing. The simple uh sch school board. I I didn't use it. I wrote things down but I didn't import it into my laptop. That's the W But also y you write things down. And i you can also bring your your your note block. So what's the what's the th what's the point of importing it into Yeah alright. For drawings, but not for personal notes. I think that's not very Uh I mean you can bring your paperwork along and p Well of course if you have a lot of paper If you've If you've Yeah I understand. But I think uh d this option is only useful if you've got a lot of paperwork. You can't It's not very uh ni Yeah well a lot of documents are Yeah. Mu Yeah right. Can we keep them? Uh. Well did you really uh Did you really take uh take those in account? I half of time I didn't notice they were there. So But we shouldn't talk about that. Because this is a realistic environment. Right. Okay. But yeah. W well th that's just the the environment they set us up f with. So Well, for drawing for drawings. Yeah. Well No But it's still an expensive uh expensive But if w Yeah. Well and if And but what if uh maybe this this board uh SMARTboard is malfunctioning or someone. But suppose it was working correctly, what uh would it be useful then, if it wasn't off all the time? A Really? Anything you want. Any b b Yeah. L li li Yeah. Well it isn't, but maybe that thing is uh is Yeah, board, a school board, yeah. Yeah. I it has It is useful. Yeah. This uh if it works correct, maybe this thing this thing is just malfunctioning. So uh if we get in uh if we get another one and you make sure it does work, I think then it's pretty useful. Because uh yeah you can draw t things quickly and uh clearly for anyone uh in the discussion room. And then you can save it immediately. Did you type that? Maybe till four o'clock or something? Well dunno. Yeah. No we must save this thing, yeah. In the shared map map. Map, is it a good word? The folder, yeah. So it is useful, yeah. No but uh Radical. Yeah. Do you believe it yourself? They also want to see my cat and his rabbit, and uh Your big beautiful bird. Maybe the pen is just uh uh broken and the board isn't. Of or the other way around uh Yeah I think so too. Who is she you're talking about? Oh you mean our uh coach, our f personal coach. Is she also our accountant? Is she responsible for sending that information so late? Oh. Because then we have to confront her with our Yeah. That that's our new slogan. Yeah, I like that. Blame our accountants. But we couldn't, yeah. Well I th Yeah.



@highlight

this is our design .

@highlight

Uh it's pretty uh much uh like uh Mike draw uh drew uh the in the during the last meeting .

@highlight

We have of course uh the the round shape uh the round uh basic shape .

@highlight

Th So there's this part um which is made of hard plastic , the front .

@highlight

Of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours , And uh we're we're using different colours .

@highlight

and the rest of it , the under uh the under side uh of it , yeah , the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium , Um then we have uh on back on the front uh the logo in the upper corner , It's a double R_ .

@highlight

Yeah the logo I think oval will be better for the for the d for the different uh channel buttons .

@highlight

the the con the the the , yeah , the t volume and the channel controls uh in the middle here .

@highlight

Um um with kind of arrow shapes , we uh the Okay button's here in the middle of the of the operators , of the channel and uh volume um changers .

@highlight

And the video button .

@highlight

Menu for the L_C_D_ screen .

@highlight

And of course this low part , this is the L_C_D_ screen .

@highlight

And we thought about the logo big in the middle .

@highlight

And the company slogan , we thought in a kind of arc shape uh above the logo .

@highlight

the voice recorder is uh at the bottom .

@highlight

Well what what what I what I agree is that when uh when um you have such of uh an arc in the middle , so that the the a the ends and the fronts is a bit thicker , so th then it falls over your hands .

@highlight

And how large is it ?

@highlight

That's the question .

@highlight

Yeah , I agree with the L_C_D_ screen .

@highlight

And if you have it li in the middle , your hand might be over it .

@highlight

But you you hold it like this .

@highlight

Well f for as far as I can see , three of us agree Well the the Well that's a reason to to to put the L_C_D_ screen uh of course on the upper side , but For me , I I wouldn't buy it .

@highlight

So let it be like this at uh at this moment .

@highlight

I'm going to do uh the ev evaluation .

@highlight

That's gonna be done at the end of seven point skill criteria .

@highlight

So I made a I made a few questions on the hand of uh uh the impor most important requirements and trends .

@highlight

Uh the first question is , uh is the device good-looking ?

@highlight

So I think it's very good-looking Easy to change channels ?

@highlight

I think it's uh as easy as uh can be made .

@highlight

Uh The uh device is easy to find if you lose it ?

@highlight

Well we don't have the device that beeps uh when you lost it or so , R_ R_S_I_ sensitive ?

@highlight

Are there enough technology ?

@highlight

Uh well well a bit , Three .

@highlight

Are the trends about fruit and vegetables implemented ?

@highlight

Three , alright .

@highlight

Is the material attractive ?

@highlight

So I would say at least two .

@highlight

look at the costs at this point .

@highlight

My god .

@highlight

The sample speaker , Kick it out .

@highlight

Then we go to fourteen point six .

@highlight

Well well why why why should we use a advanced chip ?

@highlight

Well be for the L_C_D_ uh you had said .

@highlight

What's the difference between a simple and a regular chip ?

@highlight

but it wasn't very clear .

@highlight

Well , we could say , well this special colour , that isn't that that isn't there , because the the fronts they will buy it .

@highlight

The special colour .

@highlight

But we d Then we have to lose the L_C_D_ screen .

@highlight

Yeah , we need to have the the L_C_D_ screen .

@highlight

We can also make it flat .

@highlight

Yeah , this is actually two curves , yeah .

@highlight

No , it's one curve .

@highlight

W t we can never get uh below the twelve and a half .

@highlight

Well we make it more expensive to buy .

@highlight

Well , then we have two dollars less profit .

@highlight

If if you make people brand-aware , they are willing to pay more .

@highlight

Hey but uh I think you'll agree that uh that we that now we have this uh screen , it's it's very uh not practical to ha to consider this after we have designed the entire thing .

@highlight

Why why don't we replace the titanium with uh plastic coloured titanium , Th then you have a ugly , stupid , l ugly looking , dumb remote that that no-one would buy .

@highlight

I'll put in the report we that we think that fourteen point one is the l m lowest price you can make a remote for that's trendy d these days .

@highlight

I I'll talk to the managers .

@highlight

So we have to use the ditch the titanium , I'm afraid .

@highlight

But then we can add the special colour ?

@highlight

As we have money over uh left .

@highlight

Well I think uh the case is double curved then .

@highlight

Well y we have curves in all directions .

@highlight

So alright .

@highlight

but now we're going to evaluate our project , of uh project , are we satisfactory about our creativity ?

@highlight

I think it's terrible that we got uh those costs at the last moment .

@highlight

Well in in if we consider the costs then this is the best , yeah .

@highlight

and you had to dump all your creativity .

@highlight

Uh leadership Well it's It was very democratic .

@highlight

Well the managers were terrible .

@highlight

So , with their all their useless requirements .

@highlight

teamwork ?

@highlight

Well great I think .

@highlight

Uh well what do you , what did you think about the SMARTboard ?

@highlight

It was a complete disaster .

@highlight

That one isn't accurate .

@highlight

But I I think this is meant by the digital pen .

@highlight

Uh a green uh board with uh chalk is much more useful than that thing .

@highlight

And uh the digi the digital pen ?

@highlight

It isn't practical .

@highlight

Right .

@highlight

Yeah , it might be useful for drawings .

@highlight

I I agree on that .

@highlight

N new ideas found ?

@highlight

Well I missed uh the option to uh to email , Communicate in between .

@highlight

uh which is uh made uh which is also part of the back , part of the titanium uh titanium part .

@highlight

If if you look if if this this is thick , and this is thin , th th then it that it lies over your hands .

@highlight

But and only Nils
