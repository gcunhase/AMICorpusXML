So we come again for the the second meeting. Uh for the aim of this meeting now is to to make presentation about uh the work for each one. And take the the decision about the the design and the functionality of the the remote control. And we have think I got a new project requirement. So I think uh teletext becomes outdated. So the popularity of the since the popularity of the internet, and I think we don't need lighting adaptive, so the remote control should be only used for the the television. And of course we should have our image in the in the design. So, let's start with the the industrial designer.. Or y you can use the whiteboard if you want. Here. Oh okay. This one. Do you want to open Ah. Wow. This. You can i yeah. Ma Yeah we can change the b. Yeah. Um. It's mine. Participant one, no? Mm. Oh we have so let's move to to user interface design. Participant During the weekend. That's good. Mm-hmm. This are usual functionality. Tasks. And they are small. Mm-hmm. Yeah. What do you mean by the pa pa processing will be done on the T_V_ than the So we should have specific T_V_? Or? We can use this. Yeah, we don't Yeah, I think so. J j just the remote control. Mm. Yeah, we. Yeah. Speech recognition. Keep the navigation but. So you are Mm. How the this remote? Yeah, of course small. Participant four. So Harry. Mm-hmm. But do you think what they sug suggested s possibility. Yeah. It Yeah. But is it useful or not u I don't know. There is in the Mm. I think i If it's necessary can you can do that. We can integrate small microphone in the remote so it's not really a problem. What about lighting adaptive options? According to the re to the new requirements I think we don't need that. Yeah. Mm. So we have I think we have s still we have couple of minutes. Mm-mm. So any things to to discuss? Or any suggestions? Expensive. Price. I think we we can we is the. Yeah. So you have to anticipate the the future?. In future. Okay. So let's go for the the lunch break, and we will meet after.
Just go to explorer. Or open. Participant two. Open uh. Slide show, view slide show,. One is a communication. Gateway arrays. It's a field programmable gateway arrays. Yeah. Or it's something like isn't hardware the first one? And the second one is for the software. Yeah to run th to make it run. That's it. No. Okay, and how about the battery power? Uh you mean that battery would be somewhere there and the remote contro the power to the battery comes through infrared? Into the more compact and uh okay,. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah, that's right. Having a charger rather than putting the battery cells always. People don't like it to have to buy the batteries when they run out. We just make a small charger and put it Bu Our remote, we do not want to make it P_D_A_. G Yeah, not the T_V_s. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, that's right. Oh, but you have a catch there, um assume that um if you want to go to if you are watching channel two and if you want to go to channel ninety nine, then. Uh-huh huh huh huh. Mm-hmm hmm hmm. But Yeah then yeah that's right. Mm hmm hmm. Okay. Okay. too small that it goes under the sofa and we can't find it. Yeah, that's. just give it a name and we call him. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, that's right. Okay, after having the inputs from industrial design and user interface, I think most of the points which I want to are already covered here. And to find the most interesting features what the users would be interested, then what we have done is we have put a feedback forms in all the magazines, and the users send the feedbacks, and based on that These are the findings which we got and yeah adding of a speech interface is always good for a T_V_ remote but the technology We already know that as discussed earlier An it does how feasible it is. Oh we can put an limited vocabulary as in the mobile phones. We just have the it's not going to take much space also. It's going to be very slim. And next one was the size of the remote control. It has to be of course a very slim and small one. And of course most of the people are interested in if it's less expensive, so this is an important criteria here is I mean we have to look for a trade-off. The features and the cost. Little bit more if it's with extra features. Okay. Yeah, yeah. That's right. I mean, for a lazy guys they could say nine and the nine channel comes. Or they say movie name or I don't go for movie names but only for the numbers on the channel, or volume up, volume down, brightness, contrast. So, I think this should be a good idea, to put this features. And the fourth one was the teletext in various languages. Mm, I think Yeah as discussed in the earlier meeting, but I think uh not much people are really interested in this point if it's not really required. I mean I mean yeah, it's for the um industrial design and users interface designers to decide if it's going to be working or not. I think I think as I discussed th that four points would be good for um marketing. The speech interface and uh less uh reasonable uh cost. And the lighting adaptation and the teletext. And regarding the teletext uh these are the subtitl these are the text information which you got on the televisions. If you are watching an foreign movie, you get subtitles sometimes. And uh if you are a French guy watching an English movie you would like to have it in French. And if I am a German then I would like to have the my options in German. So, the remote it should have some it should give me some flexibility of choosing the ch languages. That should be a good uh point. We already have some. Yeah, that's right. Yeah,. Okay, thank you.
Okay. Okay. Yeah, alright. So uh Well I have a PowerPoint pr presentation stored in my in my personal folder so I I I think you can reach it from here. Participant two. Yeah. Uh open. Right, so um I will talk about the the w working design and And um well I I will present my my first idea on how to build the our new remote control for television. So uh can you go one page down, please. So I think the first things to do is to define the hardware components neededs to achieve uh what we want to do. So uh mm I'm thin uh I think uh I I'll do a survey about what is uh what is available on the market and what what is the the cheapest possible things we hav we can use. Then uh I will try with the technical team to to build a prototype and to see uh with uh h how this little box would uh look look like. And how an and we can uh start troubleshooting first uh com communication problems or things like that. And when we are ready with this first prototype I I think we can add some software functionalities on a programmable chip like browsing by content or um things like that. Okay so can you go down uh So, wha what I think for now is we don't want to have a remote control w which is wired so uh I think we u we can use a battery for the. Then two programmable chips for both software functionalities and communication. And the communication with the T_V_ set is uh made through uh infrared communication So uh this is the the schema of the o of the future uh remote controls so uh you can you can see the components, uh battery and uh the two chips goes to the infrared uh connection to the T_V_ set. The one on top is for the um well the functionali the functionalities and the the th red um sorry the green one is is to well, putting things together, um f transform the data into uh qu into the format to to uh to communicate with the T_V_ set. And, that's it. I think we should use a F_P_G_A_ for for the functionalities which is easy to to t It's field programmable uh something array. Yeah. Well, uh a F_P_G_A_ is just a chip you can uh you can pr programme it uh wi with wh whatever you want. And uh well the Bluetooth chip is just responsible to uh make the communication uh between uh the two devices. No. Well, th the F_P_G_A_ will produce the the data to send. Yeah. Yeah. Alright and that's it for the working design. So if you have any questions? Uh no no no no, I think uh we have uh to to uh have uh embedded uh b batteries in in the yeah into the t. Yeah, yeah. And uh I I don't think it will need um very uh much power to make it run, so Yeah. It's a good idea. Yeah. That's a good idea. Also, but but I I I think uh the the goal is to sell our remote control. S okay, so charger for is the. Yeah. Of course. So we have to t We have to sell a T_V_ with the remote control too. I think there there is there is al there there is a a technology like show view who is already available on most of the T_V_ set on recorders or thing like that and we can try t to get this information on to the remote control to to do the processing on the remote control because Yes, that's a good idea, I think. We d we don't we we don't need really much buttons to i if we have a screen to navigate on on the T_V_ so uh Well, f four five buttons, it's sufficient. It's easy to build, it does not consume much power. Well, then y you you go to the main menu and uh you have uh go to channel and then uh you can Yeah. Maybe you. but uh I I think i i if you if you want to to make uh well a a big jump but uh well you you have to to have a a a device when you could you could Well, not a mouse but uh something that that says more clearly that uh right, left, up, down, well, the to have the ability to to to write something to the navigator, maybe directly, or So, we can think of buttons like in the telephone to send messages or things like that. But we'll see. Okay, so uh next presentation Mm. Well I I think it will be a, yes, a bit complicated to um make a speech recognisers runs on the small uh ts Yeah. And this can allow to choose the the program, for instance without uh adding uh buttons so it's a good idea. Yeah. Yeah, s s speech is a important extra feature I think Well, uh Well, we are we we just have to find a mean how to to add a m a a a microphone or uh well yes a microphone into the the remote control, so I well it will be alright. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I think it's a bit complex too For our next product, our new T_V_ set with uh automatical uh sound adjustment light. Function. Yeah, but well what about the the new project's requirement? I I I think we should give up with teletext, no? Yes. Well, so maybe we we can j we can already think uh about a way to to access the internet via the television. Because if Yeah, but uh we can think that in a few years there will be T_V_ set that can access the internet. So it's a good idea if i i if we i if if we uh think about how to to to build up our remote uh control w with this functionality in a w which will c which will come in a few years. So if we already have it in our remote control Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, to desi well, not not to implement it, but to well, to find a way to to add to add this functionality in a yeah, in an in an easy manner, if is possible. Yeah, yeah. Okay. So Okay, thank you.
Mm-hmm. Okay. Because it's open you mean. F_ five. Did you draw it? This. What is the other chip for? The one on top. For men. To the in Okay. Mm. What is F_P_G_A_? So why's it how is it different from the Bluetooth? Yeah. Programme it. Okay. Yeah. Uh So this are the they have to work together? Or? Do they have to work together or two separate choice Okay. Is the is the software par alri okay. Okay, okay. So you can control if you want, right? Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. You can put it on the charger when uh you when you don't need to use it. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Mm. Uh mm. Y yeah, yeah. Because you are using because you are using Bluetooth, if some people have P_D_A_ they can use their P_D_A_ to control the T_V_ if they want to, right? I dunno. So is mine. Oh. Yeah, this your Yeah. So you can open uh three. Yeah. So So I'm working on the technical functions design. can you show the next slide. So the the purpose is to to find uh the important questions to ask is what effect should the apparatus have. So so I found on a webs on the internet yeah. I spent a lot of time searching and uh and I found that uh the function of remote control is to send messages to television set. For example switch on, switch off, switch the next channel and so on and so on. So I found two very good prototypes for for this interface from our competitors so can you Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ours is a bit uh different. So these are two example. One is from the other one is from, yeah, uh engineering centr yeah. This is the most competing prototypes I've found. But then uh loo but then I found if you look at you see on the left one there are too many buttons Yeah. O on the right I tried to play with the problem is that uh if I have hundred channels I have uh I have to choo press the other button to choose the hundred channels and I have to compose the number so it's very lousy. So you so you move to the next the next one. Yeah, so I talk about the problem. And then I I look at the user manual they are a hundred pages thick, so we don't want that. So I propose the easy to use uh prototype. You can navigate on T_V_ screen and we can the user's preference and we need to have the T_V_ connected to internet so we end in order to access the T_V_ programmes by X_M_L_ and we need some to do some preprocessing. From the technical aspect, the processing should be done on the T_V_ set than on the on the remote controller, right? And then we the speech recognition as uh Harry says we may just put in we may K_I_V_. Yeah, all the processing is done the T_V_ is a compu has some processing power the Yeah. Yeah because are you just wondering what controller okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So i the processing on on the remote controller so it can u be used in any T_V_, any conventional T_V_ sets? Mm. Okay. N yeah, that's all. The next one? So I come up with a simple design, just keep the v navigation buttons. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Okay, that's all. Mm. Mm. No, because you choose by channel, so you choose by T_V_ program so you don't have hundred channels to choose from. If you go by channel, you don't have to do that. Ah. Ah, a big jump. A mouse or Yeah. Mm. Mm-hmm. Uh it's gonna be small. Yeah. So it'll beep if you wanna find it you just uh shout y h just it just has to re respond to you when you look for the device. I dunno how bu And responds to you, and I- mm. But I think if you to recognise numbers it's a well-studied problem. I if you just recognise uh numbers is a limited you have limited vocabulary Mm. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm. But Mm. Yeah. I no I I think that uh i if we go for quality people may tolerate for high quality and of course comes with uh reasonable cost. Maybe not less, but they may be willing to pay little bit more for comfort, yeah, extra features. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm. What is the teletext? Mm. It is interesting but we are only concerned with the remote controller. So you need s special T_V_ sets to do that? Or it's it's done via this remote controller? It's very complex. Mm. Yeah, then we can conclude that. Yeah. Yeah, but it's quite possible but maybe not in this project. Mm. Mm. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Mm. Mm. Using the T_V_ to access the internet? Or what? I didn't quite understand Yeah, okay. Yeah. The future demand, market demand. The functionality in the future. Alright. Yeah. Because all the T_V_ sets will be digital, right. All the programmes, everything will be in digital than analog. Th the system will change and we have to anticipate for those change. Okay. Thank you.

Uh for the aim of this meeting now is to to make presentation about uh the work for each one .

@highlight

And take the the decision about the the design and the functionality of the the remote control .

The one on top is for the um well the functionali the functionalities One is a communication .

@highlight

and the the th red um sorry the green one is is to well , putting things together , um f transform the data into uh qu into the format to to uh to communicate with the T_V_ set .

@highlight

I think we should use a F_P_G_A_ for for the functionalities which is easy to to t What is F_P_G_A_ ?

@highlight

It's a field programmable gateway arrays .

@highlight

So why's it how is it different from the Bluetooth ?

@highlight

Well , uh a F_P_G_A_ is just a chip you can uh you can pr programme it uh wi with wh whatever you want .

@highlight

And uh well the Bluetooth chip is just responsible to uh make the communication uh between uh the two devices .

@highlight

So this are the they have to work together ?

@highlight

Or ?

@highlight

Do they have to work together or two separate choice Well , th the F_P_G_A_ will produce the the data to send .

@highlight

Or it's something like isn't hardware the first one ?

@highlight

And the second one is for the software .

@highlight

Okay , and how about the battery power ?

@highlight

Uh you mean that battery would be somewhere there and the remote contro the power to the battery comes through infrared ?

@highlight

I think uh we have uh to to uh have uh embedded uh b batteries in in the And uh I I don't think it will need um very uh much power to make it run , so Mm .

@highlight

You can put it on the charger when uh you when you don't need to use it .

@highlight

It's a good idea .

@highlight

Having a charger rather than putting the battery cells always .

@highlight

People don't like it to have to buy the batteries when they run out .

@highlight

We just make a small charger Because you are using because you are using Bluetooth , if some people have P_D_A_ they can use their P_D_A_ to control the T_V_ if they want to , right ?

@highlight

we do not want to make it P_D_A_ .

@highlight

Also , but but I I I think uh the the goal is to sell our remote control .

@highlight

So I'm working on the technical functions design .

@highlight

So the the purpose is to to find uh the important questions to ask is what effect should the apparatus have .

@highlight

So so I found on a webs on the internet and uh and I found that uh the function of remote control is to send messages to television set .

@highlight

For example switch on , switch off , switch the next channel and so on and so on .

@highlight

So I found two very good prototypes for for this interface from our competitors This are usual functionality .

@highlight

Ours is a bit uh different .

@highlight

So these are two example .

@highlight

One is from the other one is from , yeah , uh engineering centr yeah .

@highlight

This is the most competing prototypes I've found .

@highlight

But then uh loo but then I found if you look at you see on the left one there are too many buttons And they are small .

@highlight

O on the right I tried to play with the problem is that uh if I have hundred channels I have uh I have to choo press the other button to choose the hundred channels and I have to compose the number so it's very lousy .

@highlight

So you so you move to the next the next one .

@highlight

And then I I look at the user manual they are a hundred pages thick , so we don't want that .

@highlight

So I propose the easy to use uh prototype .

You can navigate on T_V_ screen and we need to have the T_V_ connected to internet so we end in order to access the T_V_ programmes by X_M_L_ and we need some to do some preprocessing .

@highlight

From the technical aspect , the processing should be done on the T_V_ set than on the on the remote controller , right ?

@highlight

And then we the speech recognition as uh Harry says we may just put in we may K_I_V_ .

@highlight

What do you mean by the pa pa processing will be done on the T_V_ Yeah , all the processing is done the T_V_ is a compu has some processing power the So we should have specific T_V_ ?

@highlight

We have to sell a T_V_ with the remote control too .

@highlight

Yeah because are you just wondering what controller okay .

@highlight

I think there there is there is al there there is a a technology like show view who is already available on most of the T_V_ set on recorders or thing like that and we can try t to get this information on to the remote control to to do the processing on the remote control because So I come up with a simple design , just keep the v navigation buttons .

@highlight

Yes , that's a good idea , I think .

@highlight

We d we don't we we don't need really much buttons to i if we have a screen to navigate on on the T_V_ so uh Well , f four five buttons , it's sufficient .

@highlight

It's easy to build , it does not consume much power .

@highlight

Oh , but you have a catch there , um assume that um if you want to go to if you are watching channel two and if you want to go to channel ninety nine , then .

@highlight

Well , then y you you go to the main menu and uh you have uh go to channel No , because you choose by channel , so you don't have hundred channels to choose from .

@highlight

but uh I I think i i if you if you want to to make uh well a a big jump but uh well you you have to to have a a a device when you could you could but uh something that that says more clearly that uh right , left , up , down , well , the to have the ability to to to write something to the navigator , maybe directly , or we can think of buttons like in the telephone to send messages or things like that .

@highlight

Uh it's gonna be small .

@highlight

So it'll beep if you wanna find it too small that it goes under the sofa and we can't find it .

@highlight

you just uh shout y h just it just has to re respond to you when you look for the device .

@highlight

just give it a name and we call him .

@highlight

And responds to you , and Okay , after having the inputs from industrial design and user interface , I think most of the points which I want to are already covered here .

@highlight

Well I I think it will be a , yes , a bit complicated to um make a speech recognisers runs on the small uh ts But I think if you to recognise numbers it's a well-studied problem .

@highlight

I if you just recognise uh numbers is a limited you have limited vocabulary Oh we can put an limited vocabulary as in the mobile phones .

@highlight

And this can allow to choose the the program , for instance without uh adding uh buttons It's going to be very slim .

@highlight

it's not going to take much space also .

@highlight

It has to be of course a very slim and small one .

@highlight

And next one was the size of the remote control .

@highlight

And of course most of the people are interested in if it's less expensive , I mean we have to look for a trade-off .

@highlight

The features and the cost .

@highlight

I no I I think that uh i if we go for quality people may tolerate for high quality and of course comes with uh reasonable cost .

@highlight

Maybe not less , but they may be willing to pay little bit more for comfort , Little bit more if it's with extra features .

@highlight

Yeah , s s speech is a important extra feature I think I mean , for a lazy guys they could say nine and the nine channel comes .

@highlight

but only for the numbers on the channel , or volume up , volume down , brightness , contrast .

@highlight

And the fourth one was the teletext in various languages .

@highlight

we we just have to find a mean how to to add a m a a a microphone or uh well yes a microphone into the the remote control , so What about lighting adaptive options ?

@highlight

Yeah as discussed in the earlier meeting , but I think uh not much people are really interested in this point if it's not really required .

@highlight

According to the re to the new requirements I think we don't need that .

@highlight

but it's quite possible but maybe not in this project .

@highlight

So any things to to discuss ?

@highlight

I think as I discussed th that four points would be good for um marketing .

@highlight

The speech interface and uh less uh reasonable uh cost .

@highlight

And the lighting adaptation and the teletext .

@highlight

And regarding the teletext uh these are the subtitl these are the text information which you got on the televisions .

@highlight

If you are watching an foreign movie , you get subtitles sometimes .

@highlight

And uh if you are a French guy watching an English movie you would like to have it in French .

@highlight

And if I am a German then I would like to have the my options in German .

@highlight

So , the remote it should have some it should give me some flexibility of choosing the ch languages .

@highlight

Yeah , but well what about the the new project's requirement ?

@highlight

I I I think we should give up with teletext , no ?

@highlight

Well , so maybe we we can j we can already think uh about a way to to access the internet via the television .

@highlight

Yeah , but uh we can think that in a few years there will be T_V_ set that can access the internet .

@highlight

So it's a good idea if i i if we i if if we uh think about how to to to build up our remote uh control w with this functionality in a w which will c which will come in a few years .

@highlight

So you have to anticipate the the future ?

@highlight

well , not not to implement it , but to well , to find a way to to add to add this functionality in a yeah , in an in an easy manner , if is possible .

@highlight

Yeah .

@highlight

Because all the T_V_ sets will be digital , right .

@highlight

Okay .

@highlight

So let's go for the the lunch break , and we will meet after .
