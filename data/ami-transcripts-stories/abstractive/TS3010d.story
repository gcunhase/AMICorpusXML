Okay. So, now um, last time. Can you uh push the button? One time please. So I'm still the secretary. Now uh, I ask you to presentate the prototype. One of your you two. Yes. The prototype. Well, thank you. Uh, now Yes. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. And the buttons? And the joystick is for the volume and the channels. Okay, so if joystick and L_C_D_. What's the R_R_ d Okay. Very good. So, we have So, what they say on the side is put fashion there. Yes. It's good. So, that's it. That's prototype. Now, the finance. We don't know if it's th it if it's okay. So, I'm gonna look. We have Sorry? Finance is um Yeah it's No, first uh Yes. We have to evaluate the product yet. Sorry. Criteria. No, it's okay. Oh, it's okay. What do you think? Yeah. Two. You? Me too. So it's a three. So it's a Yes, it's for the younger g group. So it's uh half half of the people. So I think it's four. No. Yes. So, I think it's four. Okay. Give it a four. Yep. We put the fashion in electronics. Uh, I say uh a five. It's not fashion, it's new. It must be a fashion. But it isn't. Yes. It w If it's not a fashion we can put it in it. So, it must be a fashion. I think it's a five. No. Oh. I use my feet though. Okay. Well, I say three. So, counting then is two and a half. Okay, two. You? Me too. One. Next, six. It does not get lost easily. No, we did not. So, but can it get lost if it's such a thing? I don't think so. Yes. Not a not a normal shapes. So No. It won't get lost. So A one? Okay, a one. Next. Yeah me That was our target. Two. Yep. Right. There's a fancy look-and-feel. Okay. I say a two. It's a a bit personal. If it's fancy. So I think s two is better. No, it's new. Innovation.. Okay. Me too. Three. Yeah. Effort is three, ten and twelve. Thirty, forty, fifty,. Twenty one. So, it's uh two and three nine two and one third. Yep. Uh, nah. Okay. So, it's good. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Back to my uh Yep. Next please. So, now uh we have a product. Very happy. But uh, is it cheap enough? Um, so if uh I'll have a look. We have a battery. One battery. Okay, one battery. Electronics. Advanced chip. Yeah it's the most advanced. Chip-on-print. We have that one. We have the simple, regular and advanced. We have the adva advanced. 'Kay, so uncurved or flat. Nope. Single curved or double curved? We have double curved. So Then we have plastic, wood, rubber. we have half rubber, half plastic. No titanium. Special colour. Yes, yellow. Interface, push-button. Scroll-wheel, integrated scroll-wheel push push-button, or L_C_D_ display. So, we have the L_C_D_ We have two scroll-wheels? Or one? And it's not really a s Yeah, it's this one. Now, uh button supplement. Special colour. We already Uh, that's the from the for the buttons. The buttons are regular colour. So, then uh then then then then then then Then Uh, no. It's too expensive. So, we have to change something. Fifteen Euros. Yeah, well uh when we lose one scroll-wheel, it's okay. 'Cause we can't lose the battery. We can't lose the advanced chip. We can't lose the double curve. We have rubber, special colour. Oh, no, we No, it's uh Sorry? Um, then we uh lose two Euros. Then we have thirteen Euros. Half a Euro too much. Exactly the special colours. So That's one Euro. So, I don't think that's good. Mm I think we have to keep the L_C_D_. If Yes. Then it's only thirteen Euros. So uh yeah. Yeah. Then you have Or you have to cut this off. Then it's not good anymore. So, wait. Okay. I'll have a look. We Yellow rubber. Yeah, normal. Uh One minute, please. Uh Is it maximum. Um Yeah, it's normal colour. But if you lose the joystick, it's still uh an advanced chip? Or it's then a regular? So, the advanced is for the L_C_D_ and the regular for the joystick. And what if we lose the L_C_D_? Yeah, regular chip. But Is it a good design? Mm, yes. Then it's okay. Okay, so no joystick. Oh no, but we then we get push-buttons from half a Euro. Uh, yes, yes, yes, yes. No joystick. Push-buttons. No special colour. Twelve and a half Euros. Then it's okay. So, we have to change that a little bit. And you cannot use the red and green button. Because if you give them a s uh colour, you have to pay point two Euros. Yes. Yes. So So Well Now we have to change that, but that's okay. Rubber. What's the normal colour? So And Where's? Yeah. So, now it's Yeah. It is. But then it will be just that ones. Now it's Very good. Now, uh project eva evaluation. Well What do you think of it? Uh About the project. Okay. And you. Okay. Okay. Well, what do I have to say. I think it was good. Not too many discussions. So, it's good for the speed. So, I think we're ready. Good price. Evaluation ready. Ready. That's it.
Oh this, you mean? Yes, well uh this is it. It's uh it's uh it's yellow. And uh, this is rubber. And and and this too. The the sides. And the rest is hard plastic. And uh We uh we had some uh We had a new idea that that this can uh can be uh uh turned inside. And then it covers the these buttons until here or something. And then you can still use the the power button and the mute and the the joystick. So, you can still operate uh all the things. Because you don't always use the menu. And then it can break. Uh, well uh Big buttons. And everything is blue, except the power button. And the mute. Of uh yeah, and the mute and the the other button. Yeah. Channel higher channel button. Uh, yes. Yes, that's uh Very obvious. Yeah. R_R_'s the l the the the the company uh logo. Uh, yes. Yes. That's about here. Oh. Three. Mm Mm, four. Yeah, but it's it's Yeah. I mean it still has l large buttons and not m many buttons. So I mean, the colours are for young people, but older Yeah. Yeah. Maybe. Yes. Two. Then make it th three.. Yes, a one. I like it. One. Yes. Yeah, but uh Yeah. Yeah. Yes, a one. Yeah, okay. Mm, three. Yes. Mm-hmm. Mm, yes. Mm, yeah. Mm, yeah. Yeah. Okay. All the same uh Mm, yeah. Recognisable. Like what Yeah. Mm, yeah. Okay. Yeah, well the same. I I espe I especially uh liked the the means, the the SMARTboard and uh Yeah, it uh It brings up new ideas when you work with uh with it. Yeah. Mm-hmm. No..
I don't care. Huh? Big.. Yes. Up is channel up. Down is channel down. To the right is volume up. To the left is volume down. The R_R_? I'll get it. I think the scroll-button is something also uh new. What uh not anoth uh, not a lot of uh a lot of uh remote controls have. I think technologically I'll give it an seven. Si six six. Sorry, six. Oh, true or false. Oh, uh I'll I'll give it uh a t a two. Sorry. Five. Mm-hmm. Maybe version uh three point O_ uh has other colours. Four. Me too a two, because only the battery is not uh techin uh technologically high standard. But the rest of it is. So, I think a two. It it will be fashion. 'Kay. Three is okay. Oh, we'll wait outside. I give it a one. Say two. Two. One. Uh Just a small thing. Ah. Yellow. Looks like a pistol. Uh It won't get between uh the pillows uh on the couch. Uh Yeah, o one. Yeah. Me too. Two. Yeah? Yeah. I gave this a one because of the rubber. It feels soft. Uh, it looks like a l uh uh b uh, a bit like a joystick. It's Yeah. Yeah, f very fancy trendy. Two is okay.. Oh. I go for two because uh the the shapes are still round. Uh, the latest trends are soft things, you know, like uh I said in my presentation. Uh But the the colours are um basic, like yellow, red, um blue. Something what also younger people want. It's also a trend, so I'll give it a two. Two. Yeah, I think. Cheapest there is. Expensive. Well, it's the most advanced. Advanced. Uh, yellow. One. Joystick uh thing. We're not gonna make it. Yeah. Wh What what are the costs? Fifteen. A special colour. Uh, I don't think it's a very special colour. Yellow? Uh, is it a special colour? What? Yeah. And what if we use only one sort of um Um just only plastic or only rubber? One Euro discount. If we change the joyst uh the joystick thing into a button up, button down, button right, button left. And then we'll lose fifty cent in what? Uh uh-uh. No. And if you say it's just a r uh normal colour it's a normal colour, wh No one will see it. Normal colour, and the the joystick away, and put the button up, button down, right, left. And it's twelve Euros, I think. No. Uh, no, no, no. Uh Oh, wait wait wait. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. If we lose the L_C_D_, then we have an uh regular chip and no L_C_D_. Uh, yeah. Then you'll have to m uh see the menu on the television. And you don't have the L_C_D_. So, the T_V_s has to uh have to be up-to-date. Yeah. Yeah. Huh. No knew that. Yeah, then it's twelve Euro fifty, then it's okay. So, all the buttons has to have to be the same colour. But then the print on it will g um change it. Make it uh for everybody to see what button it is. Uh l How you call it? Recognisable, yeah. Yeah? Okay. Oh, well that's clear. And the joystick away. And its buttons. Yeah. About the process. Went good. Uh I think uh the creativity uh was good enough. We have a gun instead of a remote control. Um Uh leadership. Yeah, you were the project project manager, and uh had the final vote. So yeah that was clear. Team-work okay. Everybody uh has something uh to say about it. And uh no, uh o only the the drawing uh was very difficult. But, nah. New ideas found. Nope. No. Yep. Beer. Yeah? Okay then.
This is it. Yes. Yeah. That's on the rub rubber part. Yeah? Alright. Do we Do we change the Do we change the the order? Or are we going to uh ev evaluate it first? Okay. That's uh um That can be none. Um, we gonna do the evaluation now, together. But I have uh a introduction how it works. So, it will come up. Uh-oh. Okay. Um, yeah. Well, we uh uh, I have um thinked a few evaluation uh criterias, uh based on um our marketing strategy, on uh the latest trends, on user preferences. Uh, we have a seven point scale from uh true, as well. To false, seven? And on base of each c uh criteria, we need to um give a rating. We can uh Well, it look like this. But we gonna uh do it here, they said. So, you hope found out how to do it with a Word document. Yeah. Okay, yeah. Yeah. Um, well uh we have the Word document You So we open up that blank here. Um Think I can Uh, what this just an example. So, this not very important. But um, if I can get a number in here. Hmm. Well, uh we can't do that. Um, so uh you have to think of it as uh the remote control is techno technologically innovative. Uh, and then we have to uh agree on the rating together. And in the end, we will c uh count an average of all rating. The first uh on each item. Yeah, I think it's uh Uh, well technologically using, it's not uh it doesn't contain many new features. Only the L_C_D_. So, it Um, I think I will give it a yeah, yeah, yeah, a four. Hmm. So now i I think you uh see it um its statement. And you true or false. And true is one. So, yeah. Yeah. 'Kay. Um, well It's a one. The first item. So, okay the second item. Um, this product is for all sorts of customers. Well, it's a statement which uh I disagree with, because we uh really aim uh at at young market and I think the way it looked uh c uh totally in yellow, it's not uh really aimed for all customers. It doesn't look like that. That's uh a six. Four. Uh, okay. Mm. That's uh the motto of our company. Yeah, well do we do this with uh this product? I um Yeah. I think if we do this, as it's uh uh c uh it's really orientates on the design. Um, so I would give it a two. Two. Uh Okay. Okay. Yes, I'll think of that too. Yeah, agree? A three. Yeah okay. The next element um is the product looks good. Well personally, I do not prefer a um remote control that's fully in yellow. So, I would give this a five. We have to do our uh Two or three? Two. Okay. So, well we gonna do the next part. Uh, yep. Uh uh, the next statement. It has not too much buttons. Um, yeah, I I have uh said is not because uh a low number is better. And in the end we calculate an average. So, um that's why it's a negative in it. Um, well this one of our aims not have too much buttons. So, um uh did we uh do that? Well, uh if we go to uh this fashion, I We still have caused uh a lot of uh buttons for the numbers. But you can you can go for that. And um that way, you don't have a lot of buttons over. So, I would give this a two. One. Um, but where where is the? So Yeah, did we implement uh the sound? Yeah. It won't. One. Okay, um well we aimed for the younger market. Uh yeah, did we achieve that. I think with the way it looks and um it is designed, I will give it a two. Yeah. Uh, yes. That that was uh, yeah, one of the most important things that uh Trendwatch said. I didn't uh say it in my presentation. But um, well does it have that? I would say yes. So um Well, let's also give this a two. T Yeah. Okay. Two. And um, then the last one I could think of, uh it goes with the latest trends. If we looked at the latest trends for the uh younger people, and they ate uh fruit and vegetables, well it has a um a nice colour, uh well compared to food but we didn't uh We did not paint any uh fruit and vegetable on it for something like that. So, I would did not give this uh a one or two. I We'll go for a three. Yes. A three. Okay. So um, come back to the presentation now. So, we find yourself there, and now we have to calculate an average rating. So, we will do that. Yes. By nine. Yeah. Um, uh okay. Two. Come on. So uh, that's a pretty low rating, I think. So, according to our uh own evaluation uh we did a good job. Oh. Nah. How am I doing? Yes. And I closed your slide-show. Which one was the last for you? Uh, dreaming. Next. Finance. Yeah. One... We would have uh n For a remote control. I've For a remote control, I think it is. If we would have uh uh normal buttons instead of uh the joystick. For up down left right. The advanced chip was for the L_C_D_ wasn't it? If uh If we have the n no buttons If we have we have uh not a joystick but buttons, we would have uh, we have thirteen Euros? And then uh we move the the colour. What will that be? Yeah. still, he waited at the No. Project. Yeah, I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal um normal project without laptops uh and without these devices. I think um Well, the laptops if you have them out front of you, you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation. Um, well uh the draw-board, well you can draw things. But it not really going very convenient. Uh, maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor and uh you would also see there. And with a normal mouse. Um, and uh the project. Yeah, I agree on what was said uh mainly. Uh, yeah but you always have that some people are talking more than others. And maybe is then um the task of the the project manager to also uh ask more to the people uh less talking. To tell their opinion. Yeah. Okay.



@highlight

The industrial designer and user interface designer presented their prototype design, made of yellow rubber and hard plastic, with large, mostly blue buttons, a joystick and LCD screen.

@highlight

Led by the marketing expert, the group evaluated the prototype on a scale of one to seven, based on a set of evaluation criteria.

@highlight

The overall rating was two.

@highlight

The project manager calculated the production costs, which were too high at fifteen Euros.

@highlight

The group discussed how to make the design cheaper, and decided to keep the LCD screen, but to remove the special colour and replace the joystick with regular push-buttons.

@highlight

Finally the project manager led an evaluation of the project process before closing the meeting.

@highlight

Overall, the group were satisfied with the creativity, teamwork and available equipment, although the marketing expert thought the SMARTboard and laptops were sometimes distracting and not that helpful.
