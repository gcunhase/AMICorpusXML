Me too. Okay. Um here's the agenda for our last meeting. Um after the opening we're going to have a prototype presentation, then we're going to discuss the evaluation criteria and the financing of our remote. Then we're going to evaluate the product and I think the whole production process, and then we're gonna close it up, and we have forty minutes, so let's get started. Oh, no, let's have the prototype presentation. Right. Hmm. Yeah. Great. Okay. Okay. And did you determine um the curvature of the bottom part of it for the hand, is it gonna be a single or a double? Single. Single sounds good, 'cause it's not big enough to really constitute a double. Great. Great. I think you did an awesome job. It is beautiful, and it's everything that we discussed. Good job. Alright what's next in our agenda? Um we're gonna discuss the evaluation criteria, and that's with Courtney. Right. Mm. Right. Sqi Right. Right. 'Kay. I'll wait. Are we going to indi I say we individually rate what do you say? Just orally. Why not? We have okay. Um easy to use. I vote six. Oh, two. Uh hello, we're great. Um one. No. Me too, very chic. One, I give it a one. Oh, and ma it's a prototype, right. Well, now I'm. So, the average is about a two. Two or three. Two point five. Imagine, since we obviously don't have that. And it's i it is very ergonomically designed. It's gonna be curved. Yeah. I think so too. 'Kay. Two. Alright, average is two. Is it technologically innovative? Oh sorry I'm taking over your job here. Go right ahead. Yes. Right? We were able to do it with that kind of chip. Yeah, right. That was 'kay. And we discussed that being included. Well we don' have the you know, we can't say channel, and it changes the channel, channel eight. Right. Okay. Yeah. I'd go for a three or four on that one, so okay, let's go for a three point five. Alright, and the last criteria is it is it um Well, we've covered that with the trendy. Sure. Capable. Very capable. And it's very important. 'Kay, there we go. So. Next. It does. Very good. Alright, let's go back to this No, that's it. Hmm. Oops. Okay, so now uh we're moving on to finance, okay. I'm gonna show you an Excel spreadsheet and we're going to fill it in together based on what components we're including in our remote and see if it's under twelve fifty Euro. If so, we can proceed, if not, we need to go back to the drawing board a little bit. 'Kay? So let me bring that up. Here we go. Alright. Um it's not hand dynamo, it's powered by battery, so we give it a Number of components you plan to use. Do I just put quantity being one battery, or Yeah. But if it's a do you wanna go for this is where we need to make a final call on if it's a lithium or do we wanna go triple A_s, 'cause triple A_s we're gonna have t do more than one battery. Oh, let's just go for a lithium. What do you say? I think uh I think the people who purchase this are gonna be technologically right. Okay, down to the electronics um section. We're gonna need this kind, correct, if we do the voice sensor, so one of those. It is a single-curved, so one of those. Oh. What's that? Yeah, that's correct. 'Kay, down here, case material. Plastic. 'Kay. Down here, interface type. We're gonna have the integrated scroll scroll wheel. Isn't oh those are just regular buttons. This? Okay, so we can just go um. Right I think she's I think what Courtney's talking about is do we need to put two here? Right. I don't know, they might put us well, let's just. Two or would it be three? Okay and we're gonna button supplements the buttons are no uh okay. Are they? Oh, right. Mm. Well, we're under cost then. Alright. No, we're under. Twelve point five is our limit. We've got eleven point two. Alright. We can go to I dunno what I just did. Okay. Now we're gonna talk about the project process um and whether or not we're satisfied with the whole process and the result. Um did we have a lot of room for creativity? Did we have a lot of room for individual leadership, um teamwork, and the means, meaning the technology that we used to produce our little guy there, and if we found any new ideas. Now, question is, how do we do this? Discuss, sure. Alright. Who want who would like to go first? Hmm. Hmm. And how did you feel about the whole the whole process though? Right, and we got say over what how technologically advanced it should be and also how fashionable, which I kind of like we yep. You know it. Um what about um the teamwork aspect? How did you guys enjoy making the model, the prototype? I think ya' did. Did you work well together in there, and 'kay. Oh my God, and we've all been a pretty congenial team here, I think. We hadn't had any ma fallings out. Irritating. Okay. Yeah. I have to knock that one down a couple notches. Yeah, digital pens. They were fine. Right, laptops are extremely handy, wireless. And that we have a shared network where we can put all of the Big brother. 'Kay, have we found any new ideas through this process? For something that looks cool and also has what I want it to b do technologically. And that's your right brain taking over, w wanting the artistic, the fashionable, the hip, you know. If we all just went out and bought useful things, I don't think I mean that's not what technology. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Just the Mac font bothers me even. But I do like iPods, go figure. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Colours. Exactly. I mean how many people went out and bough a Nokia phone, back when we were like in high school, just so they could get the changeable face plates. Okay. Anyway, so that is definitely at work. Yeah. Fashionable chic people will. Hmm. There you go, marketing. Alright. Okay, we're gonna wrap this up now. Um the costs are within the budget, we evaluated the project, and now we're gonna complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary, and then we're going to have a big giant party, apparently, according to this, so. Alright, thank you team, you did a great job, it was lovely working with you.
I wanna find our if our remote works. Oh. Whoohoo. That's nice. Good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I think it's a beautiful Yeah. Good job, you guys. Those are really good. Okay, it's a PowerPoint presentation. I don't really know exactly what we should uh talk about. It's under evaluation. Alright. Um so these are the criteria we're gonna ask, is it easy to use, is it fashionable uh yeah, I guess we should write these down so we can reference them. Like does it feel good, like yeah, physically. That's just for current trend. It doesn't really count, you guys. Yeah. But it's so we do have removable covers, right? Yeah, well then that's covered. And so we n k everybody have that? Yeah, she's got it. It's good. Yeah. Okay so, we're using the criteria uh for a seven point scale, and so we need to discuss how we feel. It falls within this range, so for easy to use, do we feel it's very easy to use? You guys Okay. Oh wait, that's false. Okay. Two. That's what I say. Okay, fashionable? No. I mean like no, I think it's very fashionable. I thi I would give it a one. Well, that's that's just like that's a clay, it's a prototype. What do you think? Okay. Yeah, it's a two. That's okay. Yeah. Um does it feel good? I feel like I think it feels good. I'll give it a two. What do you say? Okay. Oh no, it's fine, you're I mean you're Project Manager. Um yeah, I mean and it does it have voice I mean the phrase recognition on it? And there's no way you can represent it on here. Y Yeah, so. Then yes, then I would well it isn't what else would it need for it to be technologically innovative? And it doesn't cover anything other then T_V_, so I'd probably give it a three. Even though it is for just a T_V_ remote it's uh very advanced. But it is just a T_V_ remote. Well yeah, so I'd give it a two. Oh, it's very capable of being squishy and fruity. Yeah. Okay, next. So um our re model slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie appears to be a winner, and uh hopefully we'll sell millions. Good job, team. What? It it does. Thanks. Two. Yeah. Yeah, let's let's do a lithium. We're gon that's gon Nologically advanced, yeah. Yeah. Uh. Yeah. We plastic. And special colour. But it's Yeah, but i so i But will we w actually we'll need two, won't we? One for the top and then one for the s one e for each side. Okay. Like because there's like one interface right here and then because it's not gonna be on the same plane when you press the button. There's gonna have to be additional signals on the sides. So is that gonna be an extra one on each side? Or three, because of one on each side and one on top. I mean it's fine 'cause it comes out the same as twenty nine. Well less than twenty nine even. They're a special colour. Um they're uh they're a special form, 'cause they're indented. And, they're a special material. We're under. I think we just discuss it. Oh that's true. Yeah. No, yeah, that's a good point. 'Cause I'd forgotten that that wasn't our decision, yeah. Oh, overall I mean I thought we did a good job like We got to choose basically we had control over minus it being just merely a T_V_ remote we got to choose what we wanted to do with it. And we're a fashion forward technology company. Minus that one fight. Yeah. Yeah. I mean minus you guys being wha what is it, the survey, annoying or what is it? Irritating, yeah. Wow that's a it's definitely a strong one. Yeah. Yeah, and no internet. And the digital the digital pens were they were pretty cool. Yeah they were fun, even though I'm not really sure what I could do with them, but they are awesome. Yeah. And these things whoa. Yeah. And Big Brother. Yeah. Um we are really gonna sell this. Ta-da. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, 'cause they're pretty and just like Uh yeah. Yeah, no, iPods They want all those words for presentation, even the plugs. Oh yeah, everybody. Mine is amber. Oh. Look at it. That is a piece of work. Wow. Marketing Director says yeah. Fashionable people will buy it. Oh, I will create desire. We could have like an Adam and Eve type commercial, and that's the fig-leaf. Mm. That'll sell. Yeah. Yeah. You too.
Um sure. You or me? Okay. Well, since our materials aren't exactly what we were going for, I'm just gonna translate what this all means for you. The base is gonna be gunmetal gray, which is what we had decided, and it's gonna be plastic. Um then there's the latex cover, which is what you see as red. Um because it can be replaceable, we just kinda went with the colour. Um and then the buttons are actually kind of poking through rather than on top. Um and the buttons will be a l much lighter blue, almost see-through. It's just sort of a very pale blue and a light-up yellow. The whole thing lights up if you press any button, rather than it just that one button will light up. Um and then at the bottom we have our logo. Um bright yellow sort of design with the R_R_ which will actually look like our logo. And then on the side you have the buttons. They're one button, but they kind of push up and down. I don't think they're scrolling. Right, yeah. And then yeah, the buttons. Thumb-shaped. Yeah. And then the last thing is just that it'll be black labelling on top, just which we didn't do. Single. Right. Oh thank you. Feel good meaning what? Physically, okay. Yeah. True or false, easy to use. Yeah. Yeah, two. Mm I don't think it's that fashionable. I'd give it like three or four. But then I'm not fashionable, so don't use my opinion. Does it feel good? Yeah, it's gonna be thicker. Depth. I'll give it a one. Oh right, the Right. Yeah I go four. Squishy and fruity. It's just trendy, basically. Okay. It's plastic. And special colour. No, we don't have the scroll. Buttons. Oh like the twenty nine means like you have both scrolls and push-buttons. But we don't have any scrolls. Two interfaces, is that what w should we s say? Okay, fine. Yeah. And then s yeah. We're over? Okay. Oh, I see. We didn't have a whiteboard. Yeah. And no internet. I think we did well. Yep. Gouges. Irritating. And no internet. Misses. I do. There's so much available. Like it's information Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's why I don't like uh Macs or Apples, just 'cause I look at it, and I know it's probably a very good computer, but I look at it, and I'm taken back to elementary school, 'cause they look the same. They look like they did when I was in elementary school, and that's so old-fashioned to me. Exactly, so I associate them with like really low-tech, really cheap, bad Yeah. But the my but my one issue is just like the whole it's for T_V_ only. I was like who's gonna buy a remote just for the T_V_ unless they've lost theirs. You're kidding. No, no. No, marketing has to actually create the desire for it. Ri They'll be sexy with it. Oh right. Let you loose. Yeah, no. Good.
Mm 'kay, you ready? Y you read that stuff, since you wrote it. I'll be the Vanna. No. They're just buttons. On off switch will be here and as you've noticed on our prototype um they've ended up with a curvature kind of, by concave sort of thing, except for, you know, can't see underneath. So I'm hoping that when we get to production we can actually make them like that, because they're very nice to stock you know, stick your finger in. Um the two squared buttons are are two probably least used, menu, mute, and then these are the numbers, so our channel and our volume will be on either side. I'd say a single. Yeah, it's only actually the size of my hand. Whoohoo. Yeah, it was a little difficult to incorporate the cover with the cherry fruit on it. Yes. I'd say two as well. At the moment, no. Okay. I'll give it a two, because at the moment it's not looking that way. Neither are all o all the customers we have, either. Uh the shape of it actually does uh. I'd say a two. We could do it with the chip, yes. It wasn't we have no reflection of it on the prototype, but that's because it's only two dimensions, really. It Yeah. Three and an half. It's capable of being squishy and fruity. How did you get that in there? The slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie. That was good. Yep. Mm 'kay. Yeah, it's. Yep. Well, that's the push-button too, right there. Integrated scroll-wheel or push-button. We're really having just push-button interface. But it that just covers the type of button we're having. Because we're not doing a scroll on the side, it's still push-button. Push-button. But we just have push Yeah. Okay. Let's call it th Okay. Grand. So we can go to production. Go back. Previous. We think we got stifled for cri creativity by the company itself, in restricting us only to using a T_V_ remote, initially. right. Yeah. Well, no, there was there was scratching and fighting, but no. Irritating. The means, the whiteboard didn't work. A and our friend here really feels strongly about the internet. I really appreciated those, yeah. The use of the laptops for receiving everything. It was wireless too, so. And let's not forget the sexy dual microphones everyone gets to wear. The Toronto district school would only use his Macs with their kids. Well, i iPods are now quite trendy, and they come in different colours. Yeah. Not me. I didn't have a phone 'til university. That's okay. We can create a commercial where they think that all their needs will be met. This will help them find the one. That's right. And so the serpent says, use our remote. Whoohoo. Margaritas for everyone. Yay. Thanks to the Project Leader. Now we know w

The Marketing Expert gave an evaluation of the prototype using the group's initial criteria for the remote.

@highlight

The group decided that enough of their initial ideas and criteria for the remote were satisfied to be able to continue with the project.

@highlight

The Project Manager analyzed the final production cost; the cost was lower than initially projected, at 11.2 Euros.

@highlight

The group decided to use one lithium battery instead of several triple A alkaline batteries.

@highlight

The Project Manager then led a discussion on the project process.

@highlight

The group felt that they worked well together and were pleased with the prototype.

@highlight

They complained, though, that they felt constrained by the management's directives, that they had difficulties using the meeting-room equipment, and that they did not have internet access during the project.
