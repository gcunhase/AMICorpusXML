Hello. Hello. You have to put it exactly on the on the yeah. I took your mouse. Yeah just yeah, no, that's for me, I just have to make some notes. I got my uh mouse. yeah. Uh actually my laptop doesn't work, switch it on again. Oh no. So you all read what we are going to do or not? Okay. Yeah, that's right. I just made a a simple uh presentation. So you put some things in it. Okay. How does this work? I dunno. This one? Ah cool. Okay. So that's my name,. Uh we're going to make uh a remote control, you already know that. Just have a look, are we going to uh this agenda of our meeting. You know, this is about twenty five minutes, this meeting. So um the thing we have to know is you already know what we're going to do, you also read what this the things or, not yet, okay. So um, yeah, it has to be original, trendy, user-friendly that's what we're going to design. Uh first we have uh uh three steps of uh making the the remote control. Fir the first thing is th the functional design, that's very important. We have to look what the needs are, the effects of the functional design, and and how the mm the the remote control works, so that's where we're going to look in the functional design, it's for the f next meeting. The the second thing is the conceptual design, that's what it that's uh the spe the specifications of the components and the properties and the specifications of the user interface. And we have to look what uh the market is doing for what kind of uh remote controls are in the market. And the third thing is uh the detailed design um and that's exa yeah, you know what it is, it's exactly how it looks and whatever. Okay so uh no, this is a these are two smartboards, with the uh f uh s an introduction of that one. And you already saw you know all that that you here can put uh things in the the red project uh map. Folder, okay. So no okay have a look at that one. Okay. So uh what we're going to do first is um so you can read. You have to uh draw uh a favourite animal on the whiteboard and um and say why it's your favourite animal. So and you have this is just to try it out and we have to uh use a different pen colours and different thickness of the pen. So okay, so first have to show you, maybe you can come here to have a look how it works. Yes? Okay. This a new page, it's okay. Use pen format. and a different colour can use here no I just take the pink. You take oh there's no pink, okay, oh just purple, okay. No blue. And uh line width ten. Okay uh just take what I'm going to draw is an elephant. Just draw slowly, because otherwise it won't work. It's a very nice elephant, you can see. I dunno what it looks but it doesn't matter. I just h Something like this? Oh no Yeah, okay. Because I like uh okay. Just takes so long, okay. Whatever, just. You erased this one. It's a bit slow you can see, this is a bit annoying. Okay, so just for you guys just one of you can draw a painting if you want. Just don't um yeah, just u use it like that, yeah. That's okay. It's in format. Yeah. Just No it has to be an animal, so if that's it's it should be a shna snake or something. Okay. Okay okay. Okay. Okay, cool. Hmm yeah, that's nice. Uh do you have to write down why uh that doesn't matter, just it's to get used to the whiteboard, but it's okay. Just make a new blank new blank page. Yeah, not too far to the to the t pen top. Maybe you should hold your pen a bit more to the back, so that no, to the yeah. No, it's a dog. Uh we d only have twenty five minutes, so. Use your fantasy. Just hold it more more to the back then you don't have okay. No, that's okay, thank you. I thought these pens would be just um uh you write it down and you download it to Word, you already did it or no? No, not yet, okay. But it's just Sorry? Yeah, I know, but I d I I thought it would be just in in in uh typed words in Word, so that's not just it's just a picture. So it's not that cool as I th thought it would be. No. I don't know, what time did we start this meeting, I'm not sure. Half past. Okay. Okay, perfect. Yeah, thank you. Now we just have to save everything, so. Oh this is definitely the best one. Okay, so uh what we know is that we have to sell this uh remote control for about twenty five Euros. Okay, that's. And uh we have to make a profit of fifty million Euros, so we have to uh use a big market in Europe. The production cost are about half the price of selling price, sorry. So can someone make a a calculation about how many we have to sell of these to make fifty million, I dunno. Uh so we're gonna have a little discussion about um what experience are with a remote control the and everything, so just have a look how it we think about remote controls. Oh yeah, that's a good question. I think it's I'm not I'm not sure, it's not mm I think I don't think you can buy a a a universal uh remote control for twenty five Euros, so not sure, but Okay, so we we just say we just say that's universal remote control. Okay, perfect. Yeah, everything just so a lot of buttons on the remote control. No, just everything.. so yeah, what what what's a remote control, it's just a black thing with some buttons on it, it's not nothing very special, but um yeah, that's right. So do you have any ideas how it has to look for for usability or user Hmm yeah. That's right. Should be a good point. Just big enough for the buttons we have, that's that's it. But you you you you think about uh uh one you can fold open. Okay, yeah, that's cool. Maybe for the D_V_D_ pla player or something, if you just okay. Yeah. Why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control? There are buttons on it. Okay. But it's not t t t too expensive to put a touchscreen on it. Yeah. Yeah. So. And if you have a touch screen in it, it's definitely too too fragile uh fragile. No. You can put games on your remote control. Whatever. Oh maybe that's a good idea, just to put it on your television and just s recharge, you never have to use any batteries. Yeah, how m how mu how how expensive uh is a normal recharger? I dunno. Uh if you th look at the market, it's probably it's still the best way just to put batteries in it, because maybe it's too expensive. Yeah, that's right, yeah. The option, just the option, that's cool. Yeah. Has it be has does it has to b have to be um uh like a different form than a normal remote control or Yeah Yeah. Yeah, just for the T_V_ and just the normal function, that's fine. But maybe it's maybe it's very hard to to make it fold open and to l look like it's very uh uh what's it's called? Maybe it's hard t No, that's right. So maybe we have to to uh keep it like mm a square, just normal remote control. Just think about it. We have to close this uh to finish this uh meeting, so. There's some more things. We have uh another thirty minutes, so then we're going to meet again. So you know what you have to what you have to do? Yeah. Yeah, I think this if you you have to n know if it's for s a T_V_, a D_V_D_ player, all that things. Also from a user, but all these things together. Yeah, everything. Yeah, no maybe not not uh, that's not a f that's something for for for yeah. That's not for you. Just if what's in the market, what's normal, uh what kind of uh buttons do you have. Yeah, it's alright. Yeah, just is that okay? Okay. So see you in thirty minutes. For the next time you have to uh put it exactly on the square, so your laptop. No, sorry.
Good morning. Okay. Good morning. Should I bring my uh pen too? Or Okay. I do. My laptop is crashing. Cr Help help help. Test test. Yes, it's working. I think my laptop is a bit etchy. Uh p Okay. Wow. Wow. Take it easy. I I was gonna make a cat too. Okay. Nice, eh? Uh. Excuse me. Yeah, it probably would be universal. Hmm, maybe, I don't know. And uh also for the V_C_R_ and uh D_V_D_ player and okay. Yeah, probably. Okay. And how big should it be? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah n Yeah, or you c O or you could th think of an uh uh a small touch screen on the remote control. Uh maybe be uh it's it's Yeah, or um maybe to keep it uh easy and uh small. Uh like a a to have Yeah, maybe it would. Kid-proof. And uh how about the batteries? Uh should you put it in a recharger or a just Mm yeah. Yeah, I dunno. Yeah, if you buy it uh separately from your phone it's probably expensive, but I don't know what the project uh projection costs are for such a thing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but I have a mouse that's uh uh also uh Yeah, and and you just have normal batteries that you can recharge and just put it in the station, or you can change your batteries, so. Yeah. N uh if if we want to make it special, we probably have to do a lot of testing, if it really works. Yeah. Yeah. And what we have to think about too is uh uh buttons that you use often are um maybe uh like when you fold it open, when you have it closed, you can still uh do the th the functions. Yeah. But n yeah, but uh i basically when I'm watching T_V_ I'm just using like five buttons or so, so. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay.
Hello. Ah. Plate? Uh I also forgot my mouse, but I don't need my mouse, I think. Damn computers. Can you hear me? Hello? Test. I dunno. Check. Okay. I think it works. Mm-hmm. We're gonna make a remote control. Press F_ eleven. Folder, yes. Ah I can see it now. It look like a dinosaurs. Okay. Let me try one. Okay. Mm. Okay and then uh what's the colour? How do I do Ah. I'll take this one. Uh there has to be water, but Yeah yeah, but it's an animal it's an animal that lives in the water. So I first uh draw the water. Uh. Okay, and now I make the animal. It's a fish. Mm-hmm. So. Um This is a worm. Okay, who next? Uh Okay. Well Paul? I think it's a pig. Or a dog. A sheep? No. Yeah yeah, it's a real pen. Oh. Y you can you can't edit in the edit it in Word. Oh, okay. Half past ten. Brilliant. Yep. Yeah, my first question was does it have to be a a universal remote control? Because we sell it uh uh uh lonely from the t and not with the television, we sell it uh apart. So I Because Yeah, I know uh you can buy a re a universal uh control for uh only twenty uh Euros Yeah, I think. Okay. Well I th I thought about um making it the same uh style as the television, we don't have uh the same television uh all the time, so uh that's no matter. Um if we uh control the V_C_R_ and the D_V_D_ player player with it uh it has to be clear, because uh kids and uh elderly are gonna use it, so uh it's not only for the uh technical persons. Um I think it must be a very good control, so you can uh uh uh act uh use it from uh everywhere in your room, the the infrared uh thing must be from very good quality. No. Yeah. I dunno um Yes Ah that's that's Ah right right. Oh that's good, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but Yeah but it's not reachable I think, touch screen. And we have to care for uh the strength of the remote control, because uh uh remote controls are most uh things in the house that falls down on the ground and it get often uh broken. Yeah and a lots uh uh lots of kids use it and touchscreen is not uh kids uh Um Ma maybe a home station. Yeah. Ah yeah. Yeah, but a home station is uh a really good idea, because uh lots of people are uh lose their remote control and don't know where it is, and now you can put it always at the same place. Maybe it's Therefore it's a good idea, but maybe it's expensive. Yeah. You can yeah, you can buy it with it. Oh yeah. Uh I I set something on paper already, size, looks, uh usable, uh the buttons on usable places, uh the the on off button must be on top, uh it has to lay good in the hand, you you have to uh Yeah, I don't I don't know I don't know if we You can make it very special, to create our own um looks, but it's very hard to Nah. Yeah yeah, what Paul already said. Uh on on top are the the basic options on top, and if you fold it open Mm. If you if if you make to fold open it's or also an uh the strength uh is not s as good as a normal uh remote control. Okay. Um for m for me uh the Marketing Expert, the user requirements uh specification, do I need to think as a user, a as a a a only the looks and the Okay. Yeah, it's also about strength and uh for everything uh. Okay. Yep. Okay. Yeah, me too. Okay, well done. Oh Paul. Ciao. Bye bye.
Two. Good morning. Mouse. Come on. There we are. Let's just check one more time. Mm. Yeah. One uh most to the right. Yes that one. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Purple. Looks very nice. A pink elephant. The water is important. Yeah. Yeah. Like this? Okay. Um let's make it um a dog. Ooh. Ah okay. A pig? I can make a dog. Um 'Kay, I make a cat of it. Oh, not too quick. No I have it. I just draw too quick I think. Okay, that's it. More. It's just to get used to it. Yeah, that's right, it but you actually got to write on the paper. You really got to write on that paper. Yeah, but it's just a picture. You really No. It's a donkey. Uh I think it was uh Yeah. Piece of cake. Uh easy. Universal. And only television? Or more devices? Ah okay. Not just a T_V_. Okay. Well we can try to make it special. Well Yeah. Nothing N It shouldn't be too big, but I don't think we can make it too small, 'cause it has to have a lot of functions, so. We can't make it smaller than the things we see now I think. Yeah. Or we have to make something uh like uh mobile phones that you can uh fold it opem. Maybe then you can make it s smaller and uniquer, maybe more trendy. Fold open, where you can see uh more options. I think Yeah, something uh on top, just dren general things like volume and T_V_ channels and inside things you don't use that often. Yeah b I wanted No you can make an uh manual in it. But that's Yeah, I think it's much uh too expensive. Yeah, too fragile. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe that's a good idea, but yeah, we have to look at the price now I think. Well uh how much is your uh standards uh mobile phone recharger? Maybe have uh Yeah, 'cause well Yeah. Maybe uh use it as a separate option. Sell it uh separately. Rechargeable. Yeah. Yeah. Well I think we have to look at that, 'cause well you can do the standard way, but then you won't Well you can um have uh the basic things on the same place, like on off button on top and the T_V_ channels one two three four as a block, and then the volume uh obviously on t on top, so you can see. But the rest is uh you don't use that often, so if you have a clear button with an good icon on it, it should be clear as well. So it doesn't matter what place it is on the remote control I think, so you can do something unique with that. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. That's what I meant. Uh Okay, but yeah. No, what you want to do with it. Yeah, I also wrote down some stuff that you want on a Technical fun fu What do you want to do with your remote control, what do you need on your remote control. I already wrote some down, some ideas. Yep. There's already a document in the folder about it. Okay. I will. It didn't say that. Your fault. Bye bye.
