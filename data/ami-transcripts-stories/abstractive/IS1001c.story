Okay. So we are here for the concept design meeting. So, we will first start by summarizing the mm the previous meeting and the decision we've taken. Uh I will take notes during this meeting so uh that you can uh look at my uh folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards. So each of you will uh show us the various investigation they've done during uh previous uh hours. We'll then t take decision in concert and then uh uh we will uh define the nest next task, to have to be done before the next meeting. So, last time we decided to have a simple interface. We also decided to have a wheel to change channel previous channel button. Channel digit uh buttons should be uh protected by plastic cover or something for the remote control to look very simple. We have also button for volume, and to switch on off the T_V_. We have also uh the lightening feature for the remote control to be easy to find, and for fast development and low cost we have decided to have no L_C_D_ no voice features. So now uh we will have three presentations. So the conceptual specification by Industrial Designer, the specification of the U_I_ by or U_I_ okay. And uh the last point is uh trend watching by Market Expert. So maybe we can start with uh industrial design. So this is the presentation. Maybe I can switch slide uh on your request. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. But is it a significant price on the whole remote control? Because we can afford up to twelve Euros for the price of the remote control. So will will will this with uh including all possible things, so buttons, wheel and the chip, be uh lower than twelve Euros to produce? Okay You received something Hmm. And could it be adapted? Okay and there can uh recognize some commands and stuff? Okay. Yeah. Okay maybe we can just uh listen to this presentation and then take decision later on according to those news. Okay. You can easily find the button in the dark or so? It will be turned on when the when the user move the remote control I think, no? Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. True. But it can be uh battery consuming, no? To have the light always on? Well we will discuss that after maybe the other presentations. Yeah. And it is. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And also does it uh fit well in hand? Because it was uh th your wrist problem with the usage. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So it's only the central part. Yeah. With a maybe a more ergonomic design on on the bottom part. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. S Okay. Will be down or Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Mm. Yeah. Maybe the wheel will be a good advantage over our competitors. Because otherwise it's pretty standard apart the fact that it's very simple. So maybe it's worse to uh to have more expense on that's that aspect. Okay. So we can move to the Is there any question? For designer of user interface? or we can move to the next part, maybe, and discuss afterwards? Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. This is good also for Yeah. I think it is good also f to have a spongy material, yeah. Yeah, because it's robust. Yeah uh sorry? No. Yeah. Before? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's innovative to use the mm the wheel because I think no one else has. Has it? Yeah. I think it's it makes it both easy and both innos innovative. So I think it's a good aspect and it should be kept. Cool, fancy? We have to make it l look like a fruit or vegetable. Maybe uh um a colour that remember some fruit uh, things like that. Maybe yeah. Yeah, and it's ergonomic as well. A pear. Yeah. Maybe pear yeah or something like that. Yeah. We can discuss that uh. D D Is is there anything you want to add? I don't think so. I think we we can have like yeah a pear is good, fit well, or banana as you told. Something like that. But that's not in the trend.. The trend is spongy, and vegetable fruits. I think p spongy is good because it it will be robust as well. So, I think we can keep the wheel because it's uh easy, it's innovative, even if the cost is a bit higher, and we also have to find a, so, a fruit like pear or banana wit uh any others idea you have. What kind of fr fruit would you like to to control your T_V_ with? Odi Banana is also yellow so you you can't lost your remote control then. I think it's a good idea, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's a good design and it's innovative as well then. Maybe we can keep the banana. And it will be very easy to find. Yeah. Yeah it's really uh really a good point. I think it So One second. So we have to take some decision on this aspect. So, uh so for sorry, for uh component, so we have to think about those aspects, sorry. Yeah. I think it's the box that should be spongy, banana's shape. But No the button would be In fact it it should be something odd shaped, with a spongy cover. Okay odd shape with spongy cover. And standard battery okay, a chip imprint, there's no specific problem. So we agree to put the wheel So it have to it has to be symmetrical. Yeah maybe the thumb is more comfortable. Yeah I think it's okay for both right and left. Mm. I think you can turn it this way also. You can do both with both hands. I think it's okay. Well, you you will get used to it. And moreover, th the button ar are lighted so you you immediately identify the right side, because you have light on buttons. Yeah. No you you I think you will use it only on the right or left hand, whether you are righty or lefty. I think for lefty it's okay. I can do this movement, and for righty as well. I think this doesn't change that much. Yeah? So, for interface we said also that we have uh this banana shape with button on the s on the side. And and uh a wheel on the top. So the colour is yellow. I think it's uh we defined everything according to what we should what the decision we should take, yeah. So maybe we can um we can uh work on those aspects uh until next meeting. So have the final uh look and feel design according to the decision. And have the the user interface design and uh then evaluate the prodyuc the product. That is to say, uh check if it fit the the requirement uh given by the users, but according to uh your presentation it seems to be okay. It seems to be fancy, innovative, and easy to use. So so to prepare the prototype I would suggest that the Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer uh work together. That would uh be better, I think. And uh And so uh you will receive further instruction by emails, as usual. So do you need to add anything? You feel okay? You feel uh free to express what you want to say? You don't feel too constrained? You don't feel free to answer this? Okay, so See you.
Uh, I_D_ you want? Yeah. I only v have three slides, so. I just look at the mm um just this. On some web pages to find some documentation and I think a remote control is, as I s mentioned previously, you just have a a very simple chip and the mm the user interface is just done usually by push button and in our case we are using a um a wheel control. So uh uh I was looking basically for that chip, which is uh very very standard, and uh I just looked for the wheel sensor and the standard push button. And um yeah we can change directly. In fact I have the number of that element which is very standard for remote control. The push button are usually extremely cheap, but I just have one problem and this is related with the wheel sensor, which seems to be quite expensive. And I think we if we could just talk about that if we really need a wheel sensor or if we can not if if we could combine something with the push button. Uh a wheel sensor is fifty time the price of a a a push button. Yeah. Yeah I I th But I don't think that uh we should We should talk about uh the design of the box also which needs some money. But Um that's all yeah. I haven't chec Mm-hmm. Yeah but I think it's yeah Sorry, I haven't written my personal references. Um the I I just want to mention the the problem of the the r wheels sensor which is much more expensive than any push button, and if we could reduce that. We we have already some good things uh with um um with the backlight of the push button. Just to to make something which is uh slightly more design that uh a squarey box with a rubber Yeah. Actually. As soon as you thought to move the the remote control you have the light. Yeah. Again. I don't think that this is really expensive, but at the end this is plenty of unexpen eh very cheap devices but uh the bill starts to be First of all I was thinking to have a a continuous light and you w when t you you you you press the on button you have the light on your remote control, when you want to turn off your device Yeah, a little bit. A little bit. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. To s Mm-hmm. I support an apple. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Me too. Ah it's okay. I know that they do that for alarm clock also. Yeah. Mm-hmm. What about um And for maybe look and feel, what about a a piece of ice, with blue L_E_D_ inside? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Banana I think, it's a nice idea. Because But You y you don't use the banana when the banana is curving like that, but when the banana is curving like that, with the wheel on the top and to control, and here you have a a push button to Yeah. And everybody knows what is a banana. Basically. If you if you start with uh fancy fruits and fra s and tha Oh, yeah So So we will just use a a standard battery? And uh the chip we chip imprint we know exactly which one we are going to use. Uh what do you mean by case? Yeah. Uh I mean for me if we use a a spongy banana case, doesn't matter. I just want to have so something to prin to to fix my my components onto that box, and that's it. Yeah yeah. Yeah. Spongy also. Oh no I think it's possible. Yeah. Yeah. This is uh like the Mm-hmm. Wheel on the top. Button, where do we want some buttons? Yeah. Yep. Yep. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Thank you.
Mm-hmm. Abdul al-Hasred is my name. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Also have to say Did you receive the email about the voice recognition? No? Yeah. You we uh an email from the manufacturing division that they have basically a voice recognition chip already developed. Says Yeah. It says that ri right now they just use it to uh to record uh answers to particular questions. But I guess it could be I guess it's possible. I mean instead of recording the answers you can just uh record uh something simpler like a command. Yeah you reco recognize commands and you can record new commands and stuff, so if they already have it as uh as a chip then we we could use it. Okay. Mm-hmm. I have a question about that actually. Um, what is the purpose of the light? Is But But in th in the dark uh Yeah but is going to be always turned on, the light? But if you move it then you have it, you don't need to find it. You can see the buttons better, of course. Yeah. But if you move it then you have to have some sensor to when you move it to detect your movement. Yeah, but you need another sensor for that, right? Yeah no it's too expensive. Okay. Mm. Extra. Yeah, okay. Mm. Yeah, but I expected also the wheel would be cheap but you tell me that it is very expensive so, yeah. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Okay. So uh my one, it uh should be in the shared folder. So. It was last time I saw it. Okay. So, just move to the next slide. So basically want very simple, right? That's the major idea, as simple as possible. So I just look at some current designs uh on the web, of usually more complicated remote controls. And let's look at two of them because uh th even though they have many buttons they look quite simple. And in our case we just uh reject the buttons what we don't need and it become even simpler. Um. So. Yeah. Well this these uh these remotes are quite big, so go to the next page, so. We have all these buttons as you can see, but most of them, we just need the ones in the middle. So, from the bottom or whatever is there, uh the uh the numbers and then the top, uh until the ten also, this middle part, and on the left one is exactly the same. So it's basically more or less how we would like it, with a big volume control, big channel control, and mute and power, yeah? These are the basic thing. So basically, w software we will build will look more or less the same as these two. Yeah, if you have, for example I think that the volume and the buttons that are there on the top are not very easy to reach with your thumb. It could be on the right side, for example. Yeah. Because we don't have these input buttons and this other stuff that they have. And I think that the plastic cover is not very good uh idea because you open it, it can break, you ca you can do various things. Uh you just need to put the channel numbers somewhere a bit out of the way. So that they're separate a bit, yeah. Uh and it's easy to press the other the big buttons, but uh, it's not that difficult to press the the channel buttons either. Mm. Yeah, I think that if you put the cover it will be even more difficult for the user. Alright, you won't yeah. Usually what I have noticed that people put the plastic cover on things that you normally don't mess with, like buttons for t uh tuning the channels and stuff like that. Yeah. That you want to protect a bit. And I think it's uh it's reasonable. So, I don't think Yeah, this is just the the wheel. We could use the some wheels can be pushed down, could use the push down of the wheel for the record if we want. Uh so we could just basically use one just wheel and uh user could use just the wheel to do everything with the channels in that case. Yeah, I guess the market researcher will tell us all about that. Mm-hmm. Well, wou wou I think we can certainly just put the electronics in a spongy thing, it it would work, right? Yeah. You can throw it to the television. Hey that's a cool one. We could say that if you throw it, you have a sensor, and you throw it and hits the television and turns it off. When it d uh takes a shock. Yeah. How do we make it look cool is the question. Yeah. Well the obvious thing is a banana, I guess. The banana is also ergonomic. Is there any fruit that is spongy? Yeah. You can make it um It's not hard, the metal. Plastic. Mm. Yeah. Two of the button, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah so you can just have uh just have this curve, yeah, and you move uh your hand here to press the buttons and then you move uh on the other side. So you can have it on on two sides and it'll be cool, no? You can put also vibrator inside. Ah-ha. You can also take into account the fact that the banana fits with the colour scheme of our company. Yeah. I hope the students of management die, but anyway. Now who are recording this meeting? The only th Yeah. Y Yeah that can be in inside th in the structure. But uh the thing is that the buttons and the wheel have to be I mean if it's spongy then the buttons and the wheel have to I mean if it's spongy then it's going to move, right? So, it's going to be bend a lot. So if we try to push the buttons, it You think it's possible? Okay. Yeah. Well, usually hold 'Kay, we want it to be good also for the left-hand users, right? Uh Yeah but okay. Sa let's say that th o It has to be basically you can only take two sides, one on ths this side where is the thumb and the other side where there is uh yeah also the thumb. Basically. Or you could use use this one, but I don't know if it's very comfortable, to use this one for the wheel. This for the wheel and then this for the buttons? Should have the two sides. So if the left, we have the op Wheel Wheel buttons. Yeah, the problem is if you have buttons and wheel then when you turn it around, the buttons are on the other side. So you cannot see them. Yeah. So the buttons have to be here and the wheel has to be Y Yeah I know, but uh if you hold with your left hand, and the wheel is here, and the buttons are here, then when you turn it around the buttons will be on the other side. Okay. Okay. Maybe. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yes master. No. Yeah. Yeah. No. Maybe you can make uh uh mm okay.
Okay, I can go? Can I? So now the recent investigation we we have done fo of the remote control um. So, the most important aspect for remote controls is to be fancy look and feel and not current functional look and feel. And um the second aspect is uh that the remote control should be uh technological innovative. And the third most important aspect is to to is that the co remote control should be easy to use. So, are things we are we have uh speak about before. Yeah. And um so you you can go after. And there is a fashion watchers in Paris and Milan that have detected the following trends, uh fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes, shoes, and furnitures. So, maybe if our remote control have to be a fruit form or vegetable form something like that, or And the mm the material is expected to be spongy. Uh I don't know which material can be spongy, and if you Mm-hmm. Okay It's robust, yeah. Not good. An and and uh this uh you can yeah you can say that. You ca uh you can go uh before, before, yes. And you know here the more iz important aspect is the fancy look and feel, after is uh technological innovative, and after the easy to use. Yeah that's why Yeah that's why I think we have to keep that if it's possible. Innovative. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Oh, colour, yeah. Oh i i I thought about a a pear, for example. You know the pear, is like that and it's it's easy to to have in in hand and uh Yeah. Or a fruit like that. I dunno. Yeah. But you don't have Yeah.

He showed how the new design will be more simple and ergonomic than the models he displayed by eliminating extra functions.

@highlight

The Marketing Expert presented news about trends in fashion and in the market that will be incorporated into the design.

@highlight

A fruit and vegetable theme and spongy materials are popular trends that will be used in the design.

@highlight

The group finalized which features they wanted to integrate into the design.

@highlight

They decided to make the remote shaped like a banana and spongy, to have the buttons lighted, to have a wheel sensor at the top of the device, and to use only a standard chip and battery that would not accomodate speech recognition.

@highlight

The Project Manager instructed the User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer to construct the prototype, and announced that the prototype would be evaluated in the next meeting.
