Yes. Yeah, Martin. Mar Ah. Yeah, ho Mm. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. But you no specific uh views for mountains or old town or I mean people prefer any windows. Oh. Oh. Yeah, I guess those thin lines, or I mean they're windows or Okay. Oh oh k okay oh 'kay. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah yeah. Yeah. And then one of old town. Yeah. Oh. So you can't do any partitions? I mean, you plan to do any partitions in three p person rooms or like this kind of blocks? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, just three desks, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. But how often the lounge is used, um People uses on regular basis daily basis or Oh. Yeah. Okay. Hmm. Hmm. Okay. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Mm yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. So you have some Oh. So you have some books also like? Mm hmm Oh, okay. Hmm. Oh. Yeah. Yeah, you mean you can display some new journals or a new proceedings and Yeah. Yeah yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. You mean these fifty per cents, I mean, they're all separate or Yeah. Okay. Yeah, okay. Yeah. I mean, they don't Okay. Yeah yeah. Yeah okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. And then secretary has separate room. Yeah, okay 'cause Yeah, okay. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. N d Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe can you combine both, or like in two person room, Pierrette too? Yeah, Martin is fifty per cent. Maybe Okay. Yeah. One is finishing. Oh. But then you can create on more spared place in that big three piece room, no Yeah, somewhere. fifty per cent. Yeah yeah yeah. But then you can move administration to the single room. The k Because she's only fifty per cent working and and she will Oh yeah. Yeah, and give that room to f some professor with a student or from for visitor with the visiting place or Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But you can't put three desks in the two person rooms. Yeah. Yeah. Oh mm. Mm. But even like you can put mm Paola in administrate office like You're already three people. Mm, it looks like small room compared to the other three p Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. K Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's fine. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Thank you.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Uh, actually Martin is fifty per cent time. Yeah. No? Oh, because you would say that she's an assistant professor or something like that. Oh, okay. Yeah. But um yeah, maybe that's Yeah, there are full professors and assistant professors, if you want. And, yeah, it's true that she's an assistant professor, but uh well, we see, maybe we can move a little bit around just to give her uh, well, also at least, maybe not a uh an office alone, but at least with just one person, not two. We'll see. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, no, mountains are just in the far so, that's not Mm-hmm. Yeah. Um well, uh I can think of some reactions from the people wi so maybe I can Well, r Yeah, well, tell me about some of the constraints and Well, first of all I must say that there are also quite a lot of common points, so um it's probably not going to be very difficult to Yeah, please. Thanks. Perfect. So um, yeah, actually we um Well, basically the the group who produced this uh proposal is made by Susan, Martin, David and uh and myself. And we also well, Susan volunteered to ask Maggie and Pierrette about how they they felt about sharing offices, and. So, as you can see, well um Susan gets obviously the same office, which is quite a good thing. Um, then things started move a bit. It looks like I'm also in the same position. But the most obvious constraints that uh we we found here was that it was probably very difficult to have a lounge uh just a lounge in one room, because it would block us two full working places. And although it's true that the group, I agree, decided to to had to have a lounge, we propose to put the lounge uh in the room at the the upper side on on the right. Uh, so let two people share this with uh sort of a, yeah, a place where we have a sofa maybe and uh and some books. So it's obviously a calm place. People are not there to talk very loud, but they can sit and relax, and uh still look at at the mountains. Um, also So that's one of the main differences, I think, maybe one of the points that we have to talk about. Uh the other one is the admin office. So it's Gisella fifty per cent because she's only half time, and uh the fax machine. Um Gisella actually has a lot of phone calls to make and uh it's true that her activity is quite noisy when she's there. Um, it's also true that she has quite a lot of files for most of the the projects actually that we manage, so it appeared, at least to well to our group, that even if she's here only half time, she should have an office by her own because it would be quite disturbing for other people to to work in the the same office. Uh Gisella has has no objection against sharing the office. We thought it was more for the the calm of the the people. It's true that this blocks one of the one person rooms, but uh on the other hand, uh Maggie has no objection uh sharing an office with her assistant. And this appeared to be true also of Pierrette. We don't know about Pierrette sharing an office with two persons, but at least no problem in Pierrette sharing her office with uh Marianne, the the Swedish one, who is sort of her assistant. Um so this is why we, yeah, we put Maggie with with Bruno. And then the third main difference uh would be the the number of visitor places or free places. Uh you notice a new name in the room uh at the centre upper upper side. So that's Paola. It's true that it's someone coming next year, Susan reminded me this uh of this point, and I could not really ignore it. Uh, so um that she's an Italic, she will arrive in about two month. And the two uh, vis one and vis two, are the visitor places. You had one, I think, called free space or spare spare place. Um we didn't really reach a very good agreement on the distribution of these two rooms. So the the two at the centre, uh where is written Paola, Yalina, the two visitors and then Maria plus David. So I think there is quite a lot of space here to uh switch a little bit among the people, just to make some kind of smooth occupancy rate, so not to have one empty room when we have no visitors, um and uh then a very full room when everybody is is here. So I think we're we are quite willing to split and put say maybe one visitor with Maria and David uh fifty per cent in the other room with the second visitor, so that it smooth is. Well, yeah, exactly so the visitors are uh basically stagieur and it happens that sometimes we have two of them even if it's only for three or four month. Martin seemed to insist that when we have a visiting professor, for instance, we cannot really put him with Gisella, because, well they wouldn't feel very nice, they they made a joke about that. So we should manage some kind of decent space. It's true that these one or two last one or two years we didn't have uh a visiting professor. But um Yeah, so uh I think, yeah, these are the three main points. So one is the place of the lounge. Uh, the other one is the uh the place of the admin office with Gisella. And the third one is the number of visitor visiting people and uh, well, how many of them we want to accommodate and where where we put it. These, I think, are the three main differences. Otherwise, we pretty much agree on uh on placing people. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Um sorry? I I didn't understand. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's that's true, I think, yeah, they are are quite open to to this. Martin also reminded us that he is quite noisy. He has a lot of uh phone calls to make, even if it's here if he's here only fifty per cent of the time. Um, so yeah, I I I don't mind this, but uh that's something But it's true, yeah, we could also try to put a visitor and the professor. Um, Martin made another point. It was the fact that sometimes professor have to professors have to discuss sensitive matters about projects and financing, and they sometimes might feel uncomfortable discussing this with their well, in the presence of their P_H_D_ students. Like saying, oh I I have to reduce her t from eighty per cent to fifty per cent. That's probably something So I I mean, all these are constraints. I don't know how how you would like us to proceed from from here, or if you already have questions or reactions on this one. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah um Well Mm-hmm. Yeah, we Yeah, that's true, that's one of the problems. Um, well we were told that it was not really possible to build walls, but we noticed that this room actually has two doors. So uh we thought that maybe we could put some kind of, well, separation. I Yeah, maybe just, yeah, furniture or just uh some kind of screen. No, it's not sound-proof. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, well, it was actually this pressure from from my group that led to this, to squeeze a little bit uh the place of the lounge. Now, how for instance would the university feel about a room that would be only used as a lounge? Would they feel it's too empty and that we have too much space? Or w is there no problem? The Do do you see a problem with having a l a room just for a lounge or no? So we could have a separate room as a lounge as long as uh we pack the other offices. Mm. Personally I I have no problem with this. So um that's that's fine. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay, so I think maybe we can agree on on the lounge in a separate room if we can manage to to find space elsewhere. What about Gisella, how do you feel about putting her in a separate office? Which is the case now I think. Well she has an extra Yeah. With a visitor space, yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, it depends on what kind of visitor you are exactly. So we could say some kind of low key visitor. This is uh very nice. Mm-hmm. Actually, Gisella fifty per cent means that she's there half time, uh generally in the mornings. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Um, I think it's what I tried to to do before, it's the shared lounge, uh th Um Do you have assistants with professors? Yeah. No, I think this is quite accepted and it's a bit the case. No, I think it's uh the lounge uh the admin room An Yeah, and the number of slots for visitors and for this new student who arrives, because having just one spare place, this was probably the strongest disagreement in my group. People said uh we should have at least two or three spare places, just for, you know, growing or sometimes you have three interns that arrive. So even if they are not perfect places. Um Yeah, that's yeah, that's how we did in in our proposal, yeah. Uh. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, mm-hmm. But then we need to squeeze in in one of the three person rooms some extra visitor space and uh I I think so. If if we want to keep the reading room. Uh I think it's possible by playing a little bit with the furniture. Um, so yeah. I think another point here, and I don't know how you you feel about it, is, well, the fact that Martin is said he would be quite noisy fifty per cent of the time. So many phone calls. So I wouldn't put him in that big office, even if he's fifty per cent, but he's still a professor here and we got him from E_P_F_L_. So that I I think I mean if we need to reach a solution now, I I wouldn't mind working from your plan, and doing some changes. Or if you prefer working from mine and doing other changes. So um Okay, yeah. Depends how how easy you can write in it. Okay, so let's keep the reading room. Uh also I think Pierrette Pierrette and Martin p should deserve at least I think offices with one person, not with two. Uh Yeah. We we never asked them, it could be, but um on the other side they have, I think, no real project in common, so I wonder Whe I I think I would prefer, and probably my group would prefer, to see them with the respective assistants, and I think Pierrette plus Marianne is a very good combination. Why not switching them from, yeah, that office? Yeah, switch the whole group. Yeah, Marianne Swedish, and then Pierrette. Because there are two Mariannes. And both family names start with S_ T_ A_. No. No, not true. The just S_. Yes. Mm-hmm. Now let's do something with Martin too. Um Yeah, maybe we can write it down, say vis vis one. David is fifty per cent and visitor one should Yeah, or spare or It's fine. Mm-hmm. Gisella Yeah, mm-hmm. I think that's closer to what I said. Well, because actually we have this project in common. You know, call I_M_ two. Um yeah, I think it's And so d could we um Mm-hmm. Well, I think, yeah, always Gisella, but I think there is no way to uh Mm-hmm. Yeah, sort of second uh Um, yeah. So you would put Gisella in a one person room? Yeah? Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, we could, yeah, even put We couldn't put Maggie and Bruno together. That's obviously the case. Mm-hmm. No, let's leave it like this for the moment. How do you feel, because your office well, three persons and you are all full time in there, so you with Nancy and Maria? Uh-huh. Yeah and you have Parmenides in common with Nancy. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And do you think we could put a visitor with Nikos and Yalina? Because it's it's also it's not very clear, you know, Yalina's that we said in our meeting. Yalina's master thesis should be defended in a couple of months or something like that. So we don't really know what happens afterwards. So we could at least think it's sort of an open place. Or we could get that office for you and Nancy and put Nikos and uh Yalina with Maria and a visitor? What about that? Wouldn't you like to have a calmer spot? Yeah. Yeah, but a visitor actually uh doesn't have that much paper, so for instance maybe they don't need uh, well uh the place to put their files, you know, a smaller drawer. They just need a a desk and probably just one drawer under underneath. Yeah, probably not. I think it wouldn't be uh Yalina and maybe we could think of a visitor too here? So that Think so? Because remember there is also this Paola arriving um on the new project. So, you know, Susan insisted that uh we should be And it it's al also it's not very clear because Nikos and Yalina are Well, Nikos is um research student, Yalina will finish her master thesis, so it's Yeah, okay. Yeah, Paola or Mm-hmm. Or maybe Paola will be able to choose. Yeah, I think that's quite okay. I don't know about any preference of Maggie being alone or with Bruno, or no? Yeah. Um, David mentioned also that there should be some kind of gender balance. Uh I don't know if there is a strong constraint, but I think we are doing pretty well. Well, so I'm not sure that was what was meant, but Ha. Okay, that's fine if he mentioned this to you, that's quite nice. And okay, yeah, I'm with Martin. Not very balanced. Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's why Okay, if you don't mind me sharing the office with Martin, that's fine. Okay, yeah, that looks good. So Agnes with Marianne and David. Yeah, so you have I_M_ two in common. That's nice and he is fifty per cent, so that means the office is not very crowded. Okay, the other one is a bit crowded, but that's okay. Gisel Mm-hmm. Um I I think for the moment. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Well, what was said in in my group, actually Susan who knows professors from other um other faculties, well, she noticed that most of them have rooms alone. So this is true for Susan and Maggie, but not true here for Pierrette and and and Martin. So we can already argue that uh we're squeezing in even the the professors. It's true that the reading room But you know we fought so much to have it, so let's uh let's try to have it there. And I think putting four people in a three person room is already a sign that uh we are already quite uh quite full, so um I think, yeah, it's normally the nominal capacity of this, I think, it's uh eighteen people. Um, eighteen or or seventeen. And we're only fifteen if you don't count Paola and some visitor's place. And I think it's quite important to have space for visitors, because if you have no visitors or if you cannot take a new, well, intern, during the summer, you're very much handicapped. So I think we're, yeah, on Well, the reaction of my group was that this was almost full already, so I well, we tried to I thin Mm-hmm. Yeah, so I think, yeah, what we could say about the reading room is that we we squeeze quite a lot of people in in the other offices, so I think it's okay. Um Mm-hmm. Perfect, just save it please. Maybe it's another name. Just say okay, it's fine. Okay. So, my group also asked to circulate the final proposal just to make sure there is no major problem. And the numbers. And we're done. Thank you, sirs.
Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So you sa so Pierrette is a professor, but she's only she's only fifty per cent time. Is that why she's in a three person office? Uh-huh. I see. Mm. Mm-hmm. And what what's happening what what do you foresee happening in the next couple of years, like beyond this m b beyond this current group of people, do we do we know of any changes coming? Is the department growing? Or is it is it going to be Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. That's always the case. Yeah. And have you have you talked to th any of these people to ask them if they have any special requirements? Oh. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Of people they needed to be near or people they would needed to avoid or anything like that. Okay. Okay. Alright. But you've given people chance to say that if they really needed to? Okay, good. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. It says mountains. Is that because that's the view. Yeah? So it's the best view. You gave the reading room the best view? Mm-hmm. Okay. Oh, two mountain views. Oh, and that's old town. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. No, okay. What's that purple thing there? Oh, okay. Mm-hmm. Alright. Okay. Hmm. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Uh-uh. Mm. In the lounge, yeah. Mm-hmm. So it's not a place for discussion. And it's it's it's a quiet place. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm I see. And so i there's no are you planning some kind of partition between the lounge and the offices or ar How are you gonna keep those things I think should ask the question to you, how are you gonna keep them separate? 'Cause it seems like fairly separate functions. Book-cases or something or Yeah. Hmm. But it won't be uh an acoustic separation? So if if the Those are students there? So if they're noisy, that could disrupt the quiet of the lounge. Um, but As a separate room. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. But you've also put the lounge in a a very k kind of a high-traffic area where the mailboxes are, the printer and the restrooms. So that's um That may also tha that may be good for meeting people and bumping into people, but it's maybe against the idea if it's a very supposed to be an isolated quiet spot. So I d mm, you know Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Well, maybe if it if it helps us pack more people into the offices, because they have a private lounge. maybe it's a good thing. Saves us money. But uh Uh yeah, I guess that's Let's see, what is that? Mm-hmm. Mm yeah. But you're saying it does get used. So you've it's it's not a completely experimental concept. Your your department has a lounge and it gets used a lot. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So, can you just summarize briefly the differences between your two proposals, the key differences? Uh sh shared Yeah, the shared lounge, the the assistants with their professors. In two cases. Yeah? Oh okay. So that's okay. Yeah. So Yeah. T_V_ at The lounge, the admin room separate. Not shared. Mm-hmm. Okay, so you basically achieve that by giving less space to the reading room, I think. Yeah. Right. So I guess what One of the questions is how important is the reading room to your group really? Is it is it something that's a very valued thing that has to be protected, um, or is it okay to l make it be kind of this spare space that gets used up a little bit when you need when you have some extra visitors or things like that. I think that's Mm-hmm. Mm yeah. Mm-hmm. But I suppose once it if it gets eaten away a little bit, at one some point it becomes unuseful, and then Yeah. So it Mm yeah. Mm-hmm. So what does that mean, Swedish um Oh, I see. Okay. Okay. Oh. Okay. Just S_, uh so just to know who they are, okay. I've heard of that. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. So when you when you put four people in that office, does that mean you're planning on four desks? You need space for four desks? Yeah. Do you know if it's possible. Yeah. Mm right. Mm-hmm. And so you can fit that, you think. Mm-hmm. Mm. No? Mm. You mean Maybe you should break the wall between the men's room and the women's room. Sorry. No. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Is your person to square meter ratio within the n university norms? Overall. We don't we don't, I mean, we don't want people coming in seeing this lavish reading room and and and everyone having their own office if that's not what we are having in the other places. We have to make sure that um if for example there's a spare reading room, like we were saying before. Overall your department has doesn't have excessive space per person. Mm-hmm. Mm right. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm yeah. Mm bu Mm-hmm. Alright. Well, it's good in case I ever have to defend it. You know, it's good to have some numbers, if you can come up with some numbers uh Some And maybe uh relative to some other comparable departments. That's It's it's good to have that. But if you both agree with this plan and you think your group will be happy, then uh fine with me. I don't know about you, what do you think? Yeah? Okay. Alright. Well, thank you. No problem. Thank you. Okay.
Uh I guess I start with my presentation. We had two groups of people working on this. So we'll show you two slightly different presentations. Feel free to ask any questions or comments, obviously. Um the first one was done by myself, Bruno, Marianne and Nikos. And the rationale that we have, I'll show you the layout in a second, was that full professors would get private offices. Administration is close to the professors offices, so it's easier for the secretary to speak to everyone. The fax is in the administration office, since it's mostly used by Gisella, who's the secretary. For noise reduction purposes we've moved everyone who has office hours together, and we've also put the network printer and the photocopier in the hall. Um, so I'll just show you how that works. Basically, you can see Gisella sort of there in the middle with the fax machine, and Maggie and Susan, who are the two full professors in our department have the private offices. And the photocopier and the printer are sort of in the hall on the side there across from mailboxes. Um, just to go back, most people are grouped in projects. And we have two fifty per cent people who are half time in Geneva, half time at the E_P_F_L_ in Lausanne. And they m them we've put in three person offices, so that in the three person offices it's not constantly three people. So there's a little bit of give there. And the reading room, or the lounge as some people call it, that we have is in a central position. So basically we've got Andre and Nancy at the top. Um they don't actu they will be starting a new project together, if um if I'm not mistaken. Like I said, Susan and Maggie in the individual offices. Nikos and Yalina, who work on the same project, at the bottom. The reading room is in the middle. Um, Marianne and Bruno are at the bottom. Um, as well, Marianne works closely with Pierrette and the other Marianne. We have two Mariannes in our department. And David is a half time. So as I said, the half times are in the three person offices. And on the other side we have Maria, Martin and myself, who all work on the same project. And Martin is fifty per cent. Um Gisella, we've given her two person office for two reasons, one is because there's a spare place there, so if we want to put a stagieur or someone who just comes in for short period of time, we figured it was okay if they were in the admin office which is a little bit noisy, because they're only there for a short period of time. Um, and again the proximity to the other offices. Um so I guess that's pretty much it for our proposal. Um I don't know if you want Andre to go through his first or if you have any questions for me. She's It's Do you wanna explain how it it works or Martin is fifty per cent. Pierrette, there's two sort of statutes of professor. I guess you could say where there's Yeah. There's a professeur d'ecole and the But the idea is Maggie and Susan are sort of the senior um professors on staff so they got the the individual offices. Um the department will obviously be growing, but there are some people who only work part time, there's some people who are doing P_H_D_s or master students, who won't necessarily be there for a larger extent of time. So for example, Yalina and the Finnish Marianne are master students for right now, so whether they decide to stay and do a P_H_D_, we're not sure yet. Um, Nikos is working um as a researcher. So for him it's the same thing. There's I think the only constant people are Susan, Maggie, Andre, um Gisella, Pierrette, um and all the rest are either P_H_D_ students or master students. And again Martin and David are half time with the E_P_F_L_, so that's project dependent as well. Unfortunately, we haven't been given as much space as we would have liked, but that's always the case. Um, Susan wanted a private office, she has a preference for private offices. Other than that, no one really had any tight constraints from what I've heard. No one's explicitly said that they needed to avoid anyone else. Um Yeah yeah yeah. No, they were fine with it, so And they're both nice views. Yeah, they're windows, yeah. Or sorry, the thick lines are windows actually. We have fairly big windows in the room, yeah. So there's lots of light coming in. And one of the reasons for putting the reading room where it was is that you have a lot of light coming in, so if people just go somewhere to sort of relax and have a quiet place to sips sit, they have a lot of light and Yeah yeah. Yeah, well I mean it depends if you like looking out over the old town and the cathedral. That sort of goes both ways, but, yeah, we've got two mountain views, sort of on that side, that side, and then the last part looks on the old town. Because we're on the sixth floor, you can actually see everything, 'cause I don't think buildings are much higher than was it, six or eight floors? Yeah. The purple thing is the mailboxes. And those are fixed, we can't do anything about those. So Um, r We don't have anything like that. If we can get stuff like that, it might be a good idea. Some people might like them. At the moment we have people thre sharing like three people in a room, without any partitions and it's a little bit noisy, but people sort of get used to it and admittedly it's mostly assistants that are stuck in rooms like that, so it's junior people, but Well, do you want to do your presentation and Okay. So Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. But realistically we don't actually have that many visitors coming in. I've been here for almost two years, and we've had a couple of stagieurs, but that's it. No, for a professor, yeah, but Oh, in a way, if that's your argumentation, then put a visiting person with a senior researcher, at least, if not a professor, rather than two students. If you're gonna argue that the visitors are supposed to be important and they should have their own space, then put them with another researcher, rather than two students. Fairly regularly there's at least one or two people in there. I mean it's a Yeah. It's a fairly new thing in the department, but it's being used pretty regularly or something that a lot of people wanted, just sort of quiet space out of your office that doesn't have the office furniture, the office chairs, it sort of has comfortable sofas and armchairs and things like that, where you can just go and relax, and or if you wanna read something for a longer period of time in a more comfortable environment. And because we do a lot of reading and things like that, it does get used fairly often. We sort of have an open policy where if there's no one in there and you want to have a discussion, then that's fine, but you can't displace people who are in there reading, just because you want to have a mini-meeting or whatever. Yeah. Yeah, they're Yeah. Which is sort of why in our proposal we had it completely as a separate room. So if you really want peace and quiet, you shut the door and when the doors are shut, like unless someone's making noise right outside the door, it really is fairly quiet. Mm-hmm. Mm. I mean, suppose if the need really arises and it comes to a point where we do have a lot of people, then you can get rid of the lounge, figure out what to do with the furniture, either distribute it between various offices or put it into storage somewhere. No no no. No, this is something that it started off sort of as a discussion at the coffee table, where people were complaining that sort of in the middle of the afternoon they just wanted somewhere to go off and no have some quiet time and That's where it came from. There are bookshelves in there, but it's not really a library, 'cause everyone At the moment, everyone has a bookshelf in their office and we just go in and borrow books from everyone else. It's more really about having a comfortable place to sit um where it's not an office environment, it doesn't look anything like an office. So it's just Yeah yeah, and people can come w in with their stuff or leave a newspaper or a magazine lying around for other people. We've got a bulletin board where you can paste up articles that you think are b interesting for other people, but I d Well she shares an office, so Which is why we were thinking that it wouldn't be a problem to s keep her with a spare person, because that's the w the situation it is right now, and if you're a stagieur and you're coming, and you don't necessarily expect to have a full-blown office, if you are only there for about two months. Yeah. Gisella has a fixed schedule for when she's there, but David and Martin are sort of they f it fluctuates. Like they can't say that they'll be there Monday, Tuesday and half of Wednesday, and not the rest of the time, which is part of the problem. I mean, they can't s specify when exactly they'll be there. So our rationale for putting them in a three person room is is that it doesn't matter when they're there and whether they're there for certain hours or not. It's just either there's two or three people in those rooms, and sometimes there's less, sometimes there's more, because we also don't work fixed hours. It's not like we work, you know, nine to five or whatever. Everyone sort of keeps their own hours. Yeah. We have Pierrette and Marianne in the same Yeah. For visitors. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. I think, because it's a fairly new thing, it's a little hard to say at this point. I think that most people like it, now that it's there, they sort of see the value of it and they wouldn't want to see it wiped out entirely, definitely. Yeah. And that's the danger is Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm 'kay. Sure. Either way. Okay well, since this one's up, keep this one in. Easily, go ahead. Mm-hmm. Double rooms. Mm 'kay. Pierrette and Martin? Mm-hmm. Here? Out There's two Mariannes, one is Swedish, one is Finnish. So we just call them the Swedish and the Finnish. Oops. No, both start with S_ but Uh, it was Bruno, right? Yeah. Mm 'kay. In here? Okay. Well for m Martin If you didn't mind working with Martin, we can switch Nancy and Martin here. Oops. Yeah. Ah. Wrong keyboard. So we can say that this is sort of for But then again you get the more formal visitor in with a bunch of students in a crowded room. Well, you can say that this one is for let's say stagieurs or interns. Um Yeah. Well you can move Maggie and Bruno into this room. Move Gisella, move the other spare place to the big room, but then there's not a lot of people in there. We're not terribly noisy, I think it'll be fine. Yeah. And I am too in common with Maria. And we work on slightly different schedules too, 'cause Maria and I tend to work earlier and Nancy tends to work later. So that shouldn't be a problem. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Sure. Um, so you want to do That's gonna back-fire on me. Yeah. And that's the problem is that you either get smaller desks, 'cause the ones that we have now won't fit. No. I think it's gonna be too much. Well, Maria is full-time. So just like that? Okay. I don't think she cares. Actu Bruno did mention that he didn't want to be in a room with a lot of people, 'cause he did that before and he didn't really like it. So maybe I don't know, I can switch with him, and we can put him and Nancy together. I don't mind, it doesn't really bother me. Okay. Yeah. Well, the gender balancing, we have more women than men in our department anyways so No. Okay? Do you see any constraints from any administrative sides? Good question. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So basically, we're moving into a new space, but it's only marginally better than the old one. Mm sure, yeah, we can do that. Mm 'kay. Sure. Okay. So I'll save that. Yeah. Okay. The final copy. I'll circulate it to everyone, along with the numbers that you guys wanted to see in terms of the space. Okay? Great, thank you for your time.

One team member presented her proposal regarding the room designations of the new space.

@highlight

In her proposal, professors received private offices, administration was close to the professors' offices, and most people were grouped by project.

@highlight

A second team member presented a proposal on the same topic.

@highlight

In his proposal, there was a lounge containing workspace for two people, an admin office which Giselle had to herself, a number of people shared offices with their assistants, and visitors were placed among students.

@highlight

The group discussed and made decisions regarding the placement of professors with students, the purpose of a lounge area, the possibility of putting up partitions in the lounge, the placement of Gisella and visitors, the option to have a reading room, and how to arrange furniture in some offices.
