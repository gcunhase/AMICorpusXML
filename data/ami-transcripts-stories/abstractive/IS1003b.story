Mm-hmm. Marketing Expert. Mm. Okay. Yeah. No sure. Uh it's David Jordan. Course. Mm-hmm. No, no. Uh this one doesn't want to be moved, I think. So, I dunno, it's maybe difficult to have both, I mean the the one on the right doesn't look so simple and Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and then Yeah. Oh it should okay, yeah. The user should know. Yeah, that's gonna be the trick. Okay. So that's the point. Mm. True. Okay. What the cost is? Twelve, twelve a half. That might just So. Okay. What's the average price of this technology then? But this is what you would like to ask the user first and I don't think the user would be ready to have a I don't think well, yeah, I don't think he would, but in a sense The wire? Yeah. True. Uh that's my job. That's the Now the Yeah. Well that's actually one of the point, yeah? True. This you will see in my presentation then. Yeah. Which is participant four. So just trying to answer all the questions, if the user would be happy to have something or something else uh. We've made a study, so could you go to next slide. Sorry for the functional recurrence. So that's the standard method for marketing, okay. We had one hundred subjects, um, we observe their remote control use in a lab and then after all the experiments they had to fill up a questionnaire, um, and see what was okay or not for them. Okay. So then it's some statistics about what we observed and what they answered. Um actually seventy five percent of the users find m the most remote controls uh ugly, okay, so that's Yeah, the the look is is bad for them so uh it's your job, David, maybe. Then eighty percent of users would spend more money um actually if if the remote controls were not so ugly. So this is where we could have uh yeah, good market, I guess, if people are ready to pay more. So it's it's interesting information, I think. And then um yeah, the remote controls like the one you've shown previously it's not so doesn't fit the user requirements sometime, because it's too many buttons and so on. So we should change this as well. And uh users are actually zapping a lot, so they're using the device intensively, that's something to take into account as well. And um, you know, ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control. And uh this is one of the main point for me. But I'll come back to it later. 'Kay. Could you go next slide? Uh, so as you said uh, remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room. So this is from the experiments we've done, so if we could solve this problem this would be interesting for the user, I think. Um it takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for thirty five percent of the people. And uh remote control are really bad for R_S_I_ problems for twenty six percent of the users. R_S_I_ is like, when you're using the same um doing the same movement several times, then you get injured. Okay? So, those numbers are less important then the previous one, but still it has to be taken to count. So last slide. Um so my pres personal preferences for this problem is we have to meet the user needs. If we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our uh concurrent, okay. And definitely if it could have less buttons, still maybe the same number of um functions, but less buttons, this would definitely be a good way of selling more. Okay. So Yeah, remember the user is not happy to read the manual. It's Yeah. Yeah, this is something we sh But this was first step and This was the first step, yeah. Specially distribution, yeah. Uh Yeah, but this is what we would ask to the users, so. Yeah. Yeah, remember it's twelve Euros. Hmm. Yeah, it's done, just yeah. If we would if we could remember like, not too many buttons and make it look fancy, I think it would make it. So. Lame, or Mm-hmm Yeah. Mm-hmm. So has to be yellow. I don't think it's part of the remote control design anyway. It's maybe more in browsing. Yeah. Hm-mm. Mm-hmm. Min Yeah. Regarding the first line, what So we're just expecting no more use of the teletext. And that's it. It's already changed for Mm-hmm. Industrial Designer. Yep. Okay. Yeah.
Industrial Design. One one. Three three, it's three sorry. In one, sorry. So you didn't save it maybe. Alright, so David Jordan? Mm-hmm. Too great for email then. Yeah. To merge the two system huh. Mm yep. But But this is Yeah. Yeah you maybe you have some international standards, where you know, if you can use one is the other are or almost the same, so the sign. Yeah, yeah. For example, I dunno here, escape, you know, you have escape in computers you have, so if you see escape, you know that it should be the same. So you have to The sh the user there for example the power off button it is something very international, you know that So. Yeah. So. Yeah, but the question is how to merge you know the Google system to the system, alright. That's your job It you Okay, okay. Participant two. Yeah. The rationale must be design, or So we can move to the next slide. As you all know, you know m my job is to design you know uh to give an industrial design of the remote control. So the re basically the remote control will be, you know, infrared control, so the problem is how to relate the how to relate the remote control device, like for example this one I h I'm holding in my hand and the T_V_. So, this one is leather bu based but I propose a nifra infrared base you know, so so for me I think that it is better it's bet it's better to control T_V_ so you know, so it's it will be cheaper and it is less technology than, you know For the cheap price we have, for the cheap price we want to I think it's cheaper than laser, so. Yeah, I think for the cost we want for the cost we want it's better to have uh uh Let's see. Yeah. You can move to the next slide, so. So the di the differen the findings you know what you find inside the re i the the system here inside it is just, you know a bulb and an infrared bulb, so here for example the infrared bulb will be here and the bulb it will be somewhere inside. You can go to the next slide. I have some kind of pictures you know, here. You have the b the bulb, it is a blue the blue stuff here and the infrared and the infrared bulb it is the red stuff you know and so and you have the other subcomponent that are not really here so important, so. This is in fact some other component that are in between the electrical de the electronic device. Look. But here what I wanted to emphasise it is just you know the bulb and. So and the next slide, it is the last one it's So it's I think it should be wire wireless re remote con Because you know, it's easier to manage and you know because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you. Or maybe some kind of thing that we can have both, but you know, I at my side prefer a wireless. Okay, so if you have some question I didn't answer? Well the avera the average prices I think that this technology will cost, I dunno, around eight Euros, so. Or at least you know, the You'd yes, you can. It's so so bres you have to decide how how you will you know, put some energy inside, so you can think about wireless or you know it's it's a question that we can raise, so. We can think that you know, with the wire, you know, without a wire. We can have both also. Yeah, but some pa I always want to have you know, sometime I want to have wire because you know. Uh, I don't think it will be too much. Have to think about the question, you know, 'cause it's I think that you know you can always you know I think wha wha with the wire it's mm cheaper but you know the wireless it's more practical, so. Okay, yeah. Yeah but, it should be an agreement, you know, because even if you can think of the wireless, it is it's it is the job of the the the g Graphical User Designer, but you know. If it is a lot cheaper and if you want to reach for example some the the money you have, if you want to use, so it can be good to have a wireless, it it is a question. Right, so. Okay. Mm-hmm. The look, how it look like. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. The manuals. With a Look fancy. This is a question that should be asked to the If you ask the people, maybe the the marketing people. I think the solution is to have many colours of you know instead of having one grey standard Yeah, yeah, maybe. Yeah, maybe. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, hmm. Yep. So. Yellow. For cheap remote control, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, 'cause what I'm thinking is how will you will connect the T_V_ to internet, so. This is Yeah, but this this mean that your T_V_ would be able to, you know, connect to internet, you know, surf the web. Okay. It's pop I don't think it's popular, so that's the problem so. You had i if you are designing a remote control for you know the global usage, so if people don't have the technology. Yellow? Do you think that people like the colour yellow? I think if you have you know th like a yellow ribbon here is the double R_. Or should be. Yeah, so. Doesn't need to be completely yellow, but just mm. But I dunno, but why, nobody's a threat to me. Industrial Designer, yeah. Component component, yeah. Good. Okay Okay, that's clear.
So, I will open our functional design meeting. So, I will play role of the secretary. As also Program Ma Manager. So, we will have the three presentations from the In Industrial Designer, User Interface Designer and um What's your talk? Marketing Experts. And after that we uh will have the uh new product requirements, the decision on the remote control functions, and we will close the meetings after. Mm so um I suppose the first to do the presentation will be the User Interface Designer. Um, so you're participant two? No you're No, I'm participant one. Okay, never mind. 'Kay, did you save your presentation? Isn't that technical functions? Name's Jordan. So so I'll I let David Jordan do his presentation. Uh. Mm. So you propose to to have the remote control which will be powerful. So powerful, many functions and very easy to use. You mean this one? Yeah you have to learn the manual before using this remote control, I suppose. Oh you mean for the yeah pic pictograms or things like that? Yeah um such as maybe the Go on, go back and So, you will propose us something which is yeah so powerful and easy to use. Okay. So, next I propose the Industrial User Interface to present things. So you you're Um. Okay. So, Baba is the uh the Industrial Designer. Okay. Mm-hmm. So you mean that infrared control is a cheap technology? Yeah. Do y you know the requirements for the remote control? Twelve, nearly thirteen, yeah. The cost Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. What is this? Okay. Okay. Okay. So you think that uh a cable between the remote control and the T_V_ won't be a good idea. No it wou maybe it will be cheaper I dunno, I just may maybe you making a solu Yeah, but Yeah but as Industrial Designer, do you think that it will be feasible to have uh linked or to have link between the remote control and the television? I'm just asking you. Do you think it will be cheaper? Could you answer please? Okay. Yeah, but I think the wireless problem is more the um David Jordan's problem. As it's yeah. I think it's more your problem. Mayb maybe you have just to to kind of research or try to ask people if they will like something wireless or not. Okay, I'm sorry. So So just think of um the usability. Yeah. Just think of the problem. If when you have wireless remote control and if you lose it? I think it's would be easier to have a link between the remote control and the television, yeah. So I will let you to do your presentation, so. You mean the loo the look, the outside? Okay. Mm-hmm. What is R_S_I_? Ah um okay. Mm-hmm. Mm okay. And just to have uh an idea, do you think you as the User Interface Designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control, you think it's possible? Sure? Yeah? Yeah. Yeah, but do you think it will be easy to use? Because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know. Yeah, I think the Yeah, but it has to be intuitive. Yeah, okay. Okay, but Yeah, but Mm-hmm. Yeah, but I think it will increase the price of the production of the remote control. If you need to have special colours for remote controls it will cost more. Yeah, it will cost little bit more. And also f Yeah, but as soon as you speak about options, it means that the price increases, and we don't really want the price to be too too high, because we wanna be able to produce it. So, we want something fancy, as uh previously said, Florent, something very easy to use, powerful and also as uh it's written here, seventy five percent of users, they zap lot, so maybe just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap a lot. And they don't really want to zap between functions of their remote control, they want to zap between channels on T_V_. So I think you have quite lot of points to to think about and to discuss it with uh the other members. So, is it okay for your presentation? Nothing else to to add? Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm so So, I had some new information about the product requirements, so you will have to take care of it of it in your thinking, in your designing of the remote control. So the first one is that um for the designing of the remote control we don't really want to use the teletext anymore, as it's something that's It's is uh No yeah, because now everybody has internet at home, so it's better to use internet then teletext. So, you will have to think about it in your in in the design of your remote control, and also the remote control will only be used for television, so for y for you your designing, you're not you won't be uh you won't had um buttons to just to manipulate yeah to control the recorder or maybe the garage door or things like that. It's because if we want to to do remote control which will be used for for the television, for the recorder, for the camcorder and all the others, it will become too complex and it will increase the pli the price and we can't do that. We really want to focus on the remote control for the television. Is it okay? So maybe it will be easier for you to to design it, to have very powerful and easy. And also we want the image of the uh um real reaction be recognisable in the product, such as the colour and s the slogan. I mean that's uh if uh you want to buy a remote control and if you go in a shop and if you see the remote control you will recognise directly that s it's our product. So you will have to use the colour of the product, of the um um of the uh of real reaction and uh also Yeah. As we say, we put the fashion in electronics, so it has to be a fashion remote control. Fancy, fashion, powerful, easy to use. Require lot of requirements, but Yeah. Yeah. But uh that's your your job to find something mm matches. Maybe not, but mayb So. So everybody is okay with the new requirements? I think it has to be yellow. Yeah. Maybe you can change the colour, but the image of the society has to be recognised. Why you go It has to be fashion. So you have to Yeah. It has to be a fashion and really be uh the image of the society. Just when you enter you say oh, oh, it's real reaction. Think it's a re reaction remote control, so. And also it has to be attractive, of course, because if you want to sale to sell the remote control. It's okay? Yeah. Yeah. I think it would be simpler. Okay. So I will close the meeting, um just after that we'll have lunch break. And you will have in thirty minutes individual work. Uh Y you You will have as the I_D_ I don't remember what is industr Industrial Designer to put um pon yeah, and the User Interface Designer to work on the user interface concept. And Florent to work my subject. And so specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach. It's okay? I think the um session is closed. And by the way, Mister David Jordan, please record your presentations in your own folder. Not in mine. Should be better.
Okay. Okay. No no no. One. I I think I'm a. In one. It's mine. Mm yeah. Okay. Okay, so. The first I will present the technical function design for user interface for our uh remote T_V_ control. Uh I I will focus on user interface design. Um so move to the next slide. As we know our remote c rem remote T_V_ control it's very has very soph sophisticated functions, as we show from this picture. There's a lot of functions. Over, I think over s twelve or twenty s functions of a remote T_V_ control. So how can we um design a user interface with so sa with so many sophisticated functions? Um, let's move to next slide. Um. Yeah. So I so we want to design uh elegant, easy to use inter interface. A very good example is Google. As we know uh Google it's a very successful because his um powerful function, but with very easy to use user interface. Um so move to next s slide. So my job is to uh design a Google T_V_ controller which I want to have sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface. So That's the end of the talk the end of the presentation. Uh With sophisticated functions, but with very yeah powerful. Yes. Yep. Yeah. But if we have very very good user interface it take less time for user to learn how to use it. Yeah, that's my job. That's my job. It's not the easiest I've got to. Yep. Powerful and easy to use. Yeah, that's the point. So what, the wireless remote control? There's a wire with remote control? Okay. Okay. Okay. Wireless remote control. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Design a wireless remote control. Yeah. Functions. Yeah. Yeah, I think possible. Because we can We can uh mix uh several function in one button. So lets you then you have less buttons. But I'm not sure No you you can have a switch menu, so you can well for example Yeah, I think so. Like for for example you can uh you can category the function i i into several classes. Then for um you can have a switch menu, so you put the switch menu to it it tend to this kind of this category of functions. Then you you put the switch button, then it switch to another category of functions. Yeah. For example, if you have remote control you you can rem you can control your T_V_ and also you can control your uh recorder. So there's a different functions, but i if you you there's a button you can switch between control T_V_ and control your recorder. So we can has less buttons. But what I'm not so sure is about how to make the remote control look funny look fancy, not funny. Because different people have a different opinion about fancy. You know. Because maybe a colourful is fancy for some people, but maybe simple and uh uniform colourful is fancy for some for other peoples, so. Yeah, personalised colour. Because you know Yeah, because maybe some people prefer a red remote control, some people prefer black remote control. Maybe we can have di di we can have uh several options, so user can select which colour they prefer, so. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Control. Mm-hmm. Mm. Okay. But there's balance between function and the cost. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hm. Okay. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And cheap. A low cost. Yeah, there's that box in uh o of it. A pi There's that box in the T_V_, so with the set box you you can connect internet with your T_V_. Ok It's It's not so uh popular now. Mm. Global, okay. So I I so As as for the colour, what what do you think? Yellow? T_V_ remote control? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, okay. Okay. Mm. Okay. Okay. Okay.
