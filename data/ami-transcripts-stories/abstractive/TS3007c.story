Hello. Um, Project Manager, I have something to tell you. I have a little problems with my laptop. And uh s s s so I had a little less time to complete. No, a little problem, uh big problem. I just thought Um, it didn't work anymore. The entire Windows uh It it hung. During lunch, yeah. He's the master, yeah. Wow. Oh, have you considered the option of using a solar panel? W nah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Th th yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um Yeah. Um, I think you should use kinetic as a back-up. A combination, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Psycho-kinetic. Yeah. Buy a fifty cents battery and uh Well maybe I have something in my presentation to uh to cope with that. Um, isn't possible to make combination with kind of rubber is or bendable remotes where you've got a. Or do you think it Rubber casing, yeah. Yeah. Um, well d Maybe I can ask it right now the question that I have. Uh, is it possible uh of is it necessary to make a touch-screen square? It isn't, I think, yeah? We're We put fashion in electronics, so maybe we can uh Mm yeah. Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah. Okay, I I get it. Okay. That's good. Well, as long a as long as it's it's uh it's firm, and you don't uh it's not bendable or something, I th I think that goes too far. Oh. Okay. It might even bounce back when you drop it on the floor. Okay. Do your thing. Spongeball. It'll float. Tables. Ah. Hey. Twelve fifty uh When your parents are watching some boring program, you can take the remote and do something else. Take it. Ooh. S Mm-hmm. In Okay. Um the interface contents. Well that's a just simple PowerPoint mock-up I want to m make it more as dynamic for you so I'll draw there. But, the main concept is um take one big touch screen. Um, always display the primary buttons clear and visible. Maybe even li like this with uh u uses of a lot of space. And uh make the menu structure changeable. So if you press um system, that's Yeah, well m multiple system options can, maybe five or ten or or one, can fit in. Or maybe even a step further when you want to um t um have some other options that are not programmable with one horizontal button. And um other buttons can may be displayed here if that's necessary. And um well, how do uh do we want to look at uh uh f um Yeah Does a remote look Well, it's you've gotta hold it in one hand. So um the middle like all remotes have to be in a little bit small, so you can put it in inside your hands. And some remotes you can use with your thumb. But I think that's too difficult for this one. So you can make it s a little broader. Yeah. And here? And maybe use your thumb on the on the main buttons. And use your other hands on the menu structure. So here are gonna be the program buttons. One, two, three, four, et cetera. And the the volume control and program control maybe. And, down here, um, I added, this could be one uh big L_C_D_. Um, the menu structure. So you can use it in uh in this way. Um One thing you've gotta keep in mind, keep the remote clear of too much functions at the same time. Um, know that if you are changing the menu structure here, um And well, I still believe you should keep displaying the buttons. But if you're programming the colour of the T_V_, do not display twenty other options that are possible. Just keep it as simple as uh as possible. And do not use too many levels. Do not have to select a screen first and then brightness and then colour and un-plus, and um push plus twenty times. But just the um uh just in one button if possible. And um, well, you kn you all know the T_V_ levels. Um, channel one, two. And when you get to n to uh to ten, ye and want to go back, uh well you have a problem. Just m most most modern T_V_s, you you press one zero, and it goes to ten. And else, to one and through after that. So the s a button less. And um, things like teletext, put them in the menu. Things like um um Yeah. Yeah, yeah w Yeah, I I find I must trying to uh tell it. Is uh volume plus and minus? And this is program uh plus and minus. Uh Yes. Or if you're watching Studio Sports on uh on seventeen, and your wife is watching some soap on two Well yes, I think that's a good idea. But um, well m my preference would to be put it in the menu structure. And if you're using that button a lot of times, well of course the menu will still be displayed on the screen. You just don't have to play games uh in-between. But if you're really switching between two channels, you won't have time uh to d use the other options. Um, yeah already already told that. Yeah. That's my conclusion. Well, I agree, just put it in the menu structure somewhere. Um, yeah um system properties, um parental control. Yeah. Mm. Um, w well, yeah. It it has to be fast. You don't want to to go down and watch the news at eight o'clock and turn it on and wait twenty seconds for for uh the log-on screen and then remember your code and all kinds of settings. Mm-hmm. Why Mm-hmm. You c may use like when there's uh X_P_, uh a simple log-on, d you just push uh one or two or three. And if you push parents, then Yeah. To log in. Yeah. And if you puts a ye Uh-huh. And if you w you push p children, uh you don't have to uh log in, but you can only watch uh children's channels or uh Okay. Well Yeah. Well, maybe um some idea on that. Just make through a remote as it is, but make an option to insert profiles, 'cause if my grandad would buy this remote, he wouldn't want to bother with all all the all the uh things to do. Just make it an option in menu, ins install powerful profiles or something. Um, b well, still some question I have about how to incorporate those ones. You're thinking about some channels they uh cannot see, but well, I I when I think, oh yeah, for the f for all the standard channels, and only for maybe after ten o'clock uh in the evening violent films and movies uh will come and uh maybe maybe some some timing uh will be uh needed instead of uh of channels, because if you're watching uh, I don't know, you're in the at day uh, cartoons will come up m on maybe Friday night. I don't know. Yeah, the disadvantage vantage is that someone will has to send all the show-view numbers of the programs that they remotes and edit it all, will have to decide uh That isn't possible. Well, yeah you could say if parental control is only it it'll go from fourteen to sixteen with the page-up then, but Mm-hmm. Yeah, on a separate menu uh option. Yeah, well yeah, I A mail too from management that it's very popular to use voice recon recognition. But I don't think when you're watching T_V_ uh, hearing loud noises from the T_V_, someone screaming one, and you f the channel switches, uh Yeah. Yeah. W you can put it on chip anyway, so uh As long as it's isn't a primary feature of the remote, but uh Optional in But how we do it? Well, I think also it's a good idea, buts very difficult to incorporate. So we should make it too complex. Is t some menu uh function, you choose parental control, and maybe four files will emerge from menu where put it on. But uh how how it's gonna work uh uh will f be a problem. Mm-hmm. Well Ye I I think best would be uh to put it in and make it an menu option. You can put on Yeah. And you can just uh s when you buy it, you can select um personal preference, parental control on, and the password or something. Oh, it's a p Yeah. Well, maybe you just have to restrict it to what programs, where the parent says, you cannot watch channel seven, nine, and ten, and you cannot watch all channels after ten o'clock. And there's just some little uh clock in the remote. No, no, it's very simple. There uh th I h I've seen some of remotes who have a clock in it. So, the remote does doesn't transmit when it's after twelve clock. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's To put it very blunt, that's not our problem. Just have um the parents buy uh some glue and uh It's not not a part of the remote. You have to f Yeah. Uh, or make it ourselves very diffic Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Oh. Yeah? I'm listening. Um, well What I was thinking about is just a menu structure, when you don't use it is simple. And when you push uh system properties, uh entire list pops up with e ev all kind of f stuff you can program. Som some bench-marker. Oh. Uh, logo. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Well, you can show somebody a logo for point five seconds, they'll still remember it. And it it l linger on every time you see it. Very annoying. Yeah. Yeah, I It's ok For f Oh, for the next meeting, right? Um Stay here and P_. Ah, no new email. Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much. Yeah. Uh-huh. See you. Yeah. Here? Or uh Yeah. If you got a No. So Stupid manager. No. Don't get what's
Hey, Project Manager. What was it, problem? The laptop? It hang hung. Ha-ha. Oh. Project Manager. You're our Project Manager. Master. Master of I'm sorry. Okay. Go on. Yeah but when the power gets low, you have to shake it or something? Uh, and uh uh Hmm. Mm yeah. It's too less space. And when the battery doesn't work, I usually shake it too. So Like slamming on it. It's exactly the same. Hmm. But, are you going to draw it? The Yeah. Yeah. Uh, I c I can't imagine. I can't imagine how how how it looks like. Yeah. Design. Mm-hmm. Uh Oh, okay. Okay. Oh, okay. Okay. Well, I think uh we're going to sell tell ten millions of them. So uh I bet a big company in uh Korea or Taiwan, like uh Samsung, can give us uh a big discount on the chips, so U usually, chips are uh aren't more expensive than one dollar. So That that shouldn't be a real issue, I think. Yeah, a combination. Yeah. Like an uh aku uh Acu uh, yeah. Well,. Yeah. Combine them. Okay. Of course. Fifty cent. Rubber. Rather hard. Yeah. Well, I think that touch-screens are generally square. But it's the case you put around it that makes the shape. Hmm? Yeah okay, but if you have a square uh L_C_D_ screen, and you put a case around it that has uh like bulbs or that that covers part of the L_C_D_ screen. That That's it's custom customisable and Yeah, me too. Mm yeah. Yeah. Can I uh do my thing? It uh Expert map. Okay uh Last week I went to uh Paris and Milan for some trend-watching. For marketing. Our research and development department and I went to Paris and Milan. In Paris and Milan, we uh asked different people, uh differing in age and in income, uh the amount of money to spend, um what they like in design uh and material nowadays. Findings. Our main audience, uh so that's people below forty, uh prefer the following. At first, the colours of fruit. Very basic colours, like Janus explained. Um, fresh colours, uh green, red, uh strawberry red, uh yellow, banana yellow. Um, considering material, um Yeah. They like spongy material, like yeah a sponge-ball. Like a s soft material. Janus m uh mentioned it also. I think he did some uh some findings himself. You wer you weren't in Paris? Okay. Like this. Like big uh g flashy colours. Fresh. It's nice, I think. Okay, our secondary audience, uh people above forty a forty years in age, they like the dark traditional colours. Uh Yeah, uh materials like wood that No n j just j just a w No, okay, but just just a wooden uh look. Like uh you have those fake uh fake panels on the floor. The that isn't wood anyway, but Okay? But, that's our secondary audience. So, uh we decided to take mm yeah the people below forty. So, that this doesn't apply. 'Kay, the third. Uh, there're some overall thoughts about new remote controls. They have to look fancy. Um, they should be technological in innovative. That means uh there have to be fancy things in. Uh, and easy to use. But that's common. My personal preferences. We have to aim at a mu at the main audience. And uh, therefore use fresh colours. Uh, I'll I'll come to that in a second point. Here, think about removable covers, as seen in mobile telephon telephone market. To customise your own remote control. Like the Nokia uh the removable covers, uh just put a red on it and go to the shop and buy a green one. Uh, a third, material being used uh could well be stuff like rubber. Um, two advantages. Uh, it fits within the current market trends. And uh it adds safety to your remote uh when you drop it. So Uh to come back to your question, I think uh and the people in Milan and Paris also think that uh the rubber should be pretty hard. Like uh seen on regular mobile phones. Actually, they have a lot in common. The phones and the Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, exactly. Uh, in my second sheet of personal preferences, uh we have to reconsider the speech function uh recognition. Uh, it's very innovative. Innovative. Yeah, like something. You you can see that the market is just screaming for new technologies, like speak uh speech recognition and stuff. But, we have to keep the cost in uh in mind, but it Yeah, it it can be uh very expensive. 'Kay, second. Uh, building games like Snake or Tetris to amuse the younger users. Uh, also the link with uh mobile phones. Uh No, but No, okay. But you don't use games when you're d when you're making a telephone call. It's just the same. Yeah. When you're at college. Uh No. You al you also take uh t you take your IPac and go uh play games. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I do that, but Okay, and um And third, I stick with it, the log-in functionality uh with the slogan, take parental control to a new dimension. That's it. Yeah. Uh, what do you think about a back-and-forth come-up uh button? L like in uh internet explorer. Yeah okay, but does it that is for uh going from four to five. But if you go from two to eight, and you want Yeah, and on two. That you can switch switch easy. Yeah it is. Yeah. Mm no. That's it. Okay. Yeah. Yeah but What I see uh How I see it is you put it on the the remote and then you have like a Windows log-on screen with parents, children. Something like that. And w when you want to use the parents uh option, you have to Yeah, ok Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Pu push parents. That then then then you have to uh go to three-digit uh log-in. Like two one three. And it's in. It automatically goes Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm yeah. V violent T_V_. Yeah, of course. Yeah. Yeah, w It just has to be w when it's deliver out of the store, it has to be just simple and plain. But if you want to install it personally uh If I got kids, and I could choose between uh two remote controls. One uh w with parent control and one without, and I would would buy the one with. I th Yeah. Yeah. Yeah but yeah but that isn't possible. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah, and And and you know w uh when you install another device, uh children can still go up to the T_V_, p pop open uh the thing and and and g go to a channel. Yeah, yeah of course. But Yeah. Ah it's Yeah. Yeah, okay. But it's just an an added feature feature. Mm yeah. Yeah, like f voice recognition is too much, I think. But games. It doesn't Yeah. That that doesn't c that doesn't co Yeah, that that doesn't cost a lot of extra resources, I think. Yeah, it's it's in it. But too ma I I think so, but Yeah. To put Yeah, to put it in always. Yeah, but T_V_s aren't capable of sending. Yeah? I thought they were just a able to receive. Yeah, some. But Yeah. Yeah, j just some rules. Yeah, okay. But, on the T_V_ at least my T_V_, is a is a compartment which you can press. And there are buttons uh behind it which you can use, if you d if you don't if you don't have a Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, of course. Yeah. Or j Yeah. Ah I have to uh consult my legal advisor about it. Consensus. Oh. Oh. I I have one thing left. Maybe for uh Jerome. Um, the views. Maybe it's uh handy to build in an expert view and a simple view. Yeah. Like at In the experts view, you have a lot of more buttons. Yeah. Mm yeah, okay. Fairly enough. Yeah. Yeah, wh which buttons you like or not. Yeah. Yeah. Just leave the other numbers away. Okay. Go on. A little chat. Marketing. Management. Yeah, that's my function, to Okay. Go on. How I know a marketing name for our product. R_ th R_ to the third power. R_ three. Real Reaction remote. Mm-hmm? Bling. Yeah. Yeah, okay, but it has to be like a split second, because you have to put in a code also and Yeah. Yeah. That spins around like all the time. It it's just like a uh globe in Internet Explorer. Okay. Who uh Who who gave you the master class? Ronald Betenberg? Okay, thanks. Ah. In the master class. Yeah. Me too. Thank you too, lord. 'Kay guys, lot of success.
Hi. Yeah, sure. Okay. Uh, let me see. I think it's this one. Ha. Right. Uh, well, I'll be talking about the components. Uh, what I did was I reviewed previously used items uh by uh two two uh different uh age groups. Uh below forty five and above. And uh I just uh watch what the differences are and I checked uh, well, what what d do we want, and how can we uh d aim a at uh the target group. Well uh what I found was that a senior um senior citizens uh Ye Ah, it's it's okay. Uh They, well, they like more the they like the traditional materials, like wood and and such more. Wood and chrome. And uh uh they like uh straightforward shapes. Um, uh they they they they like luxurious uh styles, where whereas the young and dynamic, they like a more uh soft materials. Think of the Teletubbies, for instance. Uh uh, soft and fluffy and colourful and Well uh, shapes are curved and round. Y y you get the picture. And uh they like sports and gaming, and that gives them uh the vitality. Uh, so w well uh, firs Yes. Yeah. No, I'll I'll get to that. You you'll see. Yeah. Uh, well f first off, let's start start with the energy. W I uh I had a choice between uh a few different uh sources. But uh the two basic sources that I found were the best possible were the battery uh versus kinetic. Uh kinetic, that's when you move something, then uh it gets energy. I figured, well that's ki kinda high-tech, when when you have a remote control that well, when you pick it up, it has power. That would be actually very nice, uh I figured. Well, we could also use a battery, that's a bit Yeah. Yeah yeah, you c just you have to shake it around a little bit. And then then it d then it has some more uh energy. Well, y you could just go for a battery. Or you can go for both? Yeah, I actually did. But uh the thing is about solar panel is you have to have l uh light. Well, sunlight preferably. Uh, and you you could you could use normal light, but uh you wouldn't get the same amount of energy that you would from a battery or something. Uh for uh ultimate b uh n uh use of uh solar panels, you could actually use uh you could use uh solar panels, but uh you ha you'd have to implement them into uh the remote control, leaving you uh a bit less space for the interface. So uh so i i it it wo what's actually I I c just in f I've figured it out that well, uh seeing that you'll always be uh within the l uh distance of T_V_, and the from T_V_ there comes a a a whole bunch of light. So it would actually power itself uh from a T_V_. But, well you just take up all the space, and you wouldn't uh have the full amount of power actually used. So I I prefer kinetic because it's uh well, the costs aren't that much higher, and um, ju just a bit more high-tech than than a normal battery. I mean, if No, but uh d Well, you pick it up and you press buttons and y well, you Yeah, well uh actually it is. And it it if it isn't, you just shake it a bit and and add add with power up again. But, what l what Jarek said, you could you could use a battery that you'd just keep it on the recharging whenever it moves. And for rest, you'd just add juice on the battery. Exactly. And so that Uh Uh well, f furthermore, you you we uh checked uh the cases. We have uh different options uh concerning the cases. You ha I you sim uh you simply add a basic uh standard uh model uh it was kind of square and uh I figured that's a bit boring. So you you we could go for uh the single curved or the double curved. Um, single curve, it's just a well, uh, you know, it's just uh a nice curve. Or but but you could go in a in an double curves. And that's like several different dimensions. That gives you an whole new uh effec Yeah, that gives you a younger and uh more high-tech look, I f I figured. But, that uh we'll discuss later. What? You want me to draw in three-D_? Uh, yeah, I ca I ca I could I could show you. I could show you. Well uh let's say y uh you uh Let's say that's your standard uh That's a bit your d standard design. But you could actually go like uh something like this. And then uh in three-D_ effect you could go So y you you just Yeah, this is a this bit uh difficulty in I didn't take a major in art. So But but you could have uh uh a whole new uh the back back the the the depth, you could you could uh just play around a bit with. You you don't have to use standard uh Yeah you could y It leaves more space for creativity. Uh that might be an idea, but just a Well, furthermore, uh well, uh plastic versus rubber? You We could choose uh what uh what's better, plastic um or rubber. I I ch prefer rubber because it feels uh Yeah. Yeah, it's soft and it's that I like soft. Yeah, yeah I mean uh plastic uh is Plastic also has that cheap feeling to it, like plastic uh Your your I usually associate plastic with uh something that's cheap. Uh that's maybe just me, but Uh, we could uh uh, oh, talk about it later. Uh furthermore, buttons. Uh traditional uh or a touch screen. Well, we discussed it in a previous meeting, so I figured I'll just leave it at the L_C_D_. And uh chip set, well uh if we are going to use traditional buttons, we could go uh with a simple chip set. But uh if we decide to go on a n uh um L_C_D_ screen, we would use an uh we have to use an a advanced chip set. And that would bring uh the necessary costs with with it. So that's something we th have to keep in mind. If it isn't uh manageable uh budget-wise, we'd have to go over to uh to sim to simple buttons. Yeah. Yeah, probably. Yeah, probably, but But uh yeah, that's that's That shouldn't shouldn't be uh that big a issue. I'll I'll I'll just add, uh uh I put a big summary here, so we could discuss it a bit. Uh what i what are your ideas concerning battery versus kinetic? Yeah, you you you should we should A combination. Uh, you use the battery and w charge it up with kinetic. When you pick it up, it charges up. Yeah. Yeah yeah, I know. Yeah, I con Exactly. What uh what do you think? You agree? Yeah? Both? Okay. Uh, well that would bring the m m some more costs, but I mean the Who cares, right. That's the Project Manager's problem. Yeah, well Fifty cent uh Uh, why doesn't And then we have single-curved versus double-curved. That Okay. No, we'll we'll just wait and uh Uh, plastic versus rubber. Any ideas? Uh, rubber? You Uh, I figured it will be m rather than hard Nah, rubber c uh this is a casing, yeah. Rubber casing, because well if you use an uh d a touch-screen, uh it's just a casing uh around it. So um, you could go for plastic, but I figured I I I would choose rubber. Well, m I don't know. No. Yeah. That isn't Yeah, that would cover it. That that would solve the problem. So mm Uh uh so uh so what are the opinions? Uh rubber or plastic? I I I prefer rubber. Yeah, you too? You sure? You you you seemed to hesitate a bit. Yeah, it it shouldn't it shouldn't flop over when you hold it in your hand uh No, that that that that's gonna The the chip set will hold it firm in place, and uh and and uh and a L_C_D_ screen also Yeah it m might it might. Uh, tra uh traditional versus L_C_D_, well I figured we we all set on that. And uh, then also the simple versus advanced. Well I figure if we go for L_ L_C_D_, we we should have the advanced. So that shouldn't be a problem. Okay, well that's my uh Uh, you're welcome. Well, the Teletubbies sh Well, you could. You you could. Well uh Yeah. Well, I actually saw a phone that you could use as a remote, so Yeah. Hey. That might be a next step. Well, yeah. You take your uh remote with you to school. Yeah. Very nice. I don't know if it's worth uh the time and effort we are going to spend on it. Because well it's a simple function, but it's gonna take a lot of resources and a lot of time um to programming it. Because you'll have to start working with the profiles and such. And I'm not sure if it's actually worth uh investing that much time and effort into it. I don't know what But, well, if you want to I i i if we in incorporate uh the parental control, uh let's say we do, and and well whatever, cho uh child just goes up to the T_V_ and presses up for instance. Well uh, nob nobody's stopping the child from uh well checking uh the channel. But that Well, I'm not sure because um for that to happen, you d you will have to receive a signal from the uh remote control, so it would, yeah, have to be constant uh constant signalling. What m what may be better is to incorporate an uh a separate device that uh that you can program with the remote control. And that uh provides parental control, for instance. And that's just an optional uh device. So there's n that's there's uh besides uh the remote control, you'll have a separate uh Yeah? Yeah, that's true. That's true, but uh at same instant, same happens when uh you have remote control. So But, only difference is uh the uh the people buying the remote control will now get the f added feature of parental control, and those people wouldn't uh necessary want it. So, you you'd be Yeah. Yeah. I can see games happening. Yeah. Yeah, that will be nice. Well, I don't know. I I figure if you had two different remotes, you could bo choose one with uh well uh uh a receiver in it. So you could actually easily uh build in uh parental control. But it would would be uh more expensive. So, a and that that way uh you could make cheap model and a expensive model. Could ma make the uh simple model and the deluxe model, uh for instance. Yes they are. Yeah. Yeah, you you have some T_V_s any Yeah. That is true, that is true. Well yeah, you could you could easily you could easily you could easily to the mote control. But you still have the problem about uh the television itself. Yeah, yeah yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that is true. Yeah, that is true. Yeah, you could you could you could go like uh that that would actually make uh things a lot more easy. You could just blame it on television and uh make it their problem. Yeah, I figured I figure we could do that. Yeah, yeah, sure. Uh, I'm not sure what marketing thinks about it, but User profile. Well yeah, you you could actually build in a function that you can program it yourself, for the more advanced users. Yeah, which buttons do you want to in it. Because you can you can like build in a back-forward button, and uh some po somebody would just want to watch two channels. Yeah, you could you could m have people want uh want that. Ah, yeah, sure. Well, if you if you have the l L_C_D_ screen, you can you can uh have a small logo i uh at the bottom. And it could just stay there. Yeah, that spins around or something. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah, something like that. A small icon. So we're going to work together right now? Definitely. Well thank you too. You wish. M Aye? Cheers. Hey. Yeah, uh I'm not sure if we uh we Because I saw something about individual actions. Well, yeah. Right. Uh Do you have new email? Hmm.
Hello again. Mm yeah. Okay. Okay. Yes. Yes. Your project manager. Welcome to the conceptual design meeting for Real Reaction. Uh, hello again. Uh it's uh the same as the last time. Uh uh, also this time there will be uh three presentations. And we um must uh reach a decision on uh the remote control concepts. Um uh, and at the end, uh I uh, when I finish it off I have some uh input from uh a master class I uh visited. information. The the the the the concepts on uh we uh where we uh must reach a decision on. Um uh, our from uh are of two sorts. Components concepts and user interface concepts. Uh, the first one is uh really about the the the the the total package uh with uh Well, we have decided to do a do the uh with a touch-screen that must be a case around it so uh it won't be uh uh as breakable. Uh how how about the energy? Can you uh can you reload it or uh just have batteries which you must exchange? Uh, the user interface concept. Uh, with the type and uh the the supplements. So uh where to put what button. And uh uh I would say uh Jans, can you begin? Okay. At the end, uh I will take notes uh and at the end of the minutes uh will uh be at the shared folder. Mm-hmm. One one little question. Um about the the material. Uh a soft material for a remote control? Okay. Yeah. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Oh. But you prefer kinetic? Okay. Yeah, but you don't move a a remote control too much. And that's enough to to keep the energy level uh Okay. Okay. Thank you, Tim. Yeah. Dynamic dynamic look? A little artistic. Okay. It's soft. That's the material the younger people want uh, ain't it? Just like the watch from Seiko. Yeah. I I uh I would prefer uh both uh too. Yeah. Combine them. Rubber. Yeah. Yeah. Mm yeah. Me too. Yeah? Okay. Mm yeah. Thank you. Yeah. Do your thing, Tim. Bring it on. Yeah. Flashy. Yeah. Yeah, but wood is not a not a material you which you build a a remote control of. Yeah but never seen one. Case. Oh, a wooden look, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Would you prefer uh uh that you can choose the colour of your uh remote control or Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Maybe you could use your remote as a phone. There are numbers on it, so uh So that you say um S_P_S_S_, and it goes to uh Okay. Yeah, but you don't use that th games when you watching television, I think. Yeah, okay. You take your remote control with you. Uh great. Oh, okay. Uh I think we can discuss a little about the the three uh kind of revolutionary things uh Tim uh came with. The parental control, the games, and the voice recognition. Uh There's n not uh too much decision on uh that one so uh I think that parental control is a good function to uh to put in the remote. I don't know how you think about it. Yeah. Yeah. No but I think most people uh find it uh much more important that their children don't watch uh sex or violence uh on the television, and uh wait uh ten or fifteen seconds longer, so they can uh finally watch it uh because of that. Uh Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well I think that's a b there's a big market for it, because uh you Yeah, you read many times in magazines same kind of stuff, and you heard on the news that uh that he Yeah, they believe that children uh are influenced by the television, and uh Well, we're we're aiming uh to uh below uh forty uh years. But there are a lot of uh people will below forty who have uh children in young age uh who who want um to uh not watch uh violent or uh Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah yeah. That's a that's a better idea? Yeah. Yeah, okay. Yeah, with and one without. Yeah. Yeah, maybe it can work with show view. Uh, you you can control your video recorder with show view. Uh, when you tick in a number, it will uh start and end uh recording. But maybe there's some option that uh that t uh the kind of show view numbers are violent, and that they are blocked out. Yeah. That's true. Yeah. Yeah. I wouldn't put it in an optional device. That that then then then it becomes too much, I think. If we do it, we we must do it in a kind of ways that like a profile, a parent profile, and a family profile, and otherwise. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And what do you uh guys think of the games in the voice recognition? I personally think that that becomes too much. It's more like it gets you to the functionality, but Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And games? That would Okay. So that will uh that that that must be in it, you think? Okay. So the games uh are in it. The voice recognition are not. And the parental control are optional? Yeah. Okay. Yeah, okay. Uh, but uh will there uh uh Like the first idea uh from uh You can buy it without and uh with parental contr control? Or are we going to put it in and uh just uh Yeah? Mm yeah. Yeah, you yo Yeah, but most often not. Yeah. Okay. So uh I think we have decided on the things that Uh from Janus, the energy, the combination between battery and kinetic. The case will be double-curved and uh rubber, in a fr flashy fruity colour uh that with cover is removable. The buttons will be uh touch-screen. Uh but there may not be too many buttons. And in the the menu structure, uh there must not to be uh Five minutes to go. Uh, too uh too many levels. And uh it must be easy to use. The parental control will be incorporated, but it must be not too complex. And the games are in it. So I think we have uh we have decided uh, okay. Uh, little more. Yeah. Like a like a moat or s or something. Yeah. Yeah, but you have that in the Yeah. You use the Yeah. It's already incorporated a little in that concept. Okay. We take it to the other meeting, okay? I have a little w uh little chat to do and uh then we uh finish. I went to uh a master class and uh uh two things uh are uh are uh can come in handy uh for us. First thing uh is uh we talked about knowledge uh management. Knowledge engineering and uh uh the fact that uh that uh that the idea of knowledge, uh sharing and learning knowledge from other companies is uh like that. It's it's uh very hot at the moment, so it's it's mostly for the management expert to to look what other uh marketing or did I said management? Oh. Just talking about myself. Uh W What other companies uh had to uh also with the the the the marketing campaign when they put on a newer remote, just some uh Yeah. Import export. And uh another one. Uh, they're a ha they're at Yeah, benchmarking, that's the word I saw. I uh couldn't uh Okay, uh another uh thing is uh there were there there was a survey, and um uh it came out that um people like to buy things from a single large provider, instead of those who uh are partnering uh with us. So, we must uh we must bring it as if uh Real Reaction is uh is big company, uh a trustful company, and uh it has m Okay. I had a I had another idea to put uh uh the whole the whole idea of uh Real Reaction and uh uh uh a single brand and uh uh that kind of thing. When you uh put on remote, you see a kind of a just like when you telephone, you see a little uh animation. Real Reaction remote. And uh with the with the with the motto, we put fashion in electronics. And then you go uh The Yeah. But w th the idea from this uh thing is that we must present it as a as we are a a single large provider who will stand on our own. Mm yep, yeah. Also also. But we we are uh Yeah yeah y yeah yeah. Okay, but uh think about that kind of things. That's what they said in the master class.. N Uh, next meeting starts in thirty minutes. So uh maybe you can go to Paris and Milan uh once again. The master class? Franz Mehler's. Uh, very special, uh next uh session. Uh idea that you uh the the industrial uh development uh centre and uh user interface uh will work together on a prototype. And uh will drawing it on the SMARTboard. So that's a kinda new uh thing. And um, the marketing expert will uh will uh ke he will be keeping busy with the product uh evaluation. But the most uh specific instructions will be sent to you by email. Yeah, the well, uh dids this what I uh what I heard. I Not in the master class. So you uh just wait for the specific instructions and uh But I think it was a very uh very good uh session, uh gentlemen. I will thank you all. And uh Give me a good evaluation. Cheers. See you in a half hour. But keep an eye on your uh laptops for a real uh Yeah, but th there's there's still the my uh instructions that you will work together. That's not my problem. Bye-bye. The project manager always works alone.
